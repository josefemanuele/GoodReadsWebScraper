Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form.

Readers of Sebastian Junger’sThe Perfect Storm, Erik Larsen’sDead Wake, and Nathaniel Philbrick’sIn the Heart of the Seawill love this deeply reported tale." —Hampton Sides,New York Timesbest-selling author ofThe Wide Wide SeaandIn the Kingdom of Ice“The Untold Story of the Edmund Fitzgerald’ has been told and retold by authors and bards. But never has it been told better than by Mr. Bacon in this colorful and compelling book.... Dead men tell no tales, but their loved ones do. Mr. Bacon tracked them down and listened.” —John J. Miller,Wall Street JournalOn the fiftieth anniversary of the Edmund Fitzgerald’s sinking, the bestselling author ofThe Great Halifax Explosiontells the definitive story of the “Mighty Fitz.”For three decades following World War II, the Great Lakes overtook Europe as the epicenter of global economic strength. The region was the beating heart of the world economy, possessing all the power and prestige Silicon Valley does today. And no ship represented the apex of the American Century better than the 729-foot-longEdmund Fitzgerald—the biggest, best, and most profitable ship on the Lakes.But on November 10, 1975, as the “storm of the century” threw 100 mile-per-hour winds and 50-foot waves on Lake Superior, the Mighty Fitz found itself at the worst possible place, at the worst possible time. When she sank, she took all 29 men onboard down with her, leaving the tragedy shrouded in mystery for a half century.InThe Gales of November, award-winning journalist John U. Bacon presents the definitive account of the disaster, drawing on more than 100 interviews with the families, friends, and former crewmates of those lost. Bacon explores the vital role Great Lakes shipping played in America’s economic boom, the uncommon lives the sailors led, the sinking’s most likely causes, and the heartbreaking aftermath for those left behind—"the wives, the sons, and the daughters,” as Gordon Lightfoot sang in his unforgettable ballad.Focused on those directly affected by the tragedy,The Gales of Novemberis both an emotional tribute to the lives lost and a propulsive, page-turning narrative history of America’s most-mourned maritime disaster.Show more"	"430"	"October 7, 2025"	"History; Nonfiction; Audiobook; American History; Historical; Adult; Music"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781324094654"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226573163-the-gales-of-november"
