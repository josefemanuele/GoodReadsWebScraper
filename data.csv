The Hunger Games have begun. . . .In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.Show more"	"374"	"September 14, 2008"	"Young Adult; Dystopia; Fiction; Fantasy; Science Fiction; Romance; Adventure"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games"

Today its message has grown more relevant than ever before.Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.Show more"	"194"	"December 6, 2011"	"Classics; Fiction; Science Fiction; Dystopia; School; Literature; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Guy Montag,Clarisse McClellan,Mildred Montag,Captain Beatty,Professor Faber,The Mechanical Hound"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13079982-fahrenheit-451"

At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”Show more"	"182"	"October 1, 1999"	"Classics; Fiction; Young Adult; School; Dystopia; Literature; Read For School"	"Unknown"	"Ralph,Piggy,Roger,Jack Merridew,Simon"	"9780140283334"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies"

But George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own.While the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composingOf Mice and Men, creating an intimate portrait of two men facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and callousness.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another.

A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world—until the unthinkable happens.InWhere the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens’s debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman, who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group. The clues to the mystery are brushed into the lush habitat and natural histories of its wild creatures.Show more"	"384"	"August 14, 2018"	"Fiction; Book Club; Historical Fiction; Mystery; Romance; Audiobook; Contemporary"	"North Carolina(United States, 1952)"	"Kya Clark,Chase Andrews,Tate Walker"	"9780735219113"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36809135-where-the-crawdads-sing"

Known “without affection” to members of the boss’s crew as “Big Country” on account of his long hair, beard, and cowboy boots, Roy is alert to the possibility that a routine assignment could be a deathtrap. Which it is. Yet what the would-be killers do to Roy Cady is not the same as what he does to them, which is to say that after a smoking spasm of violence, they are mostly dead and he is mostly alive. Before Roy makes his getaway, he realizes there are two women in the apartment, one of them still breathing, and he sees something in her frightened, defiant eyes that causes a fateful decision. He takes her with him as he goes on the run from New Orleans to Galveston, Texas—an action as ill-advised as it is inescapable. The girl’s name is Rocky, and she is too young, too tough, too sexy—and far too much trouble. Roy, Rocky, and her sister hide in the battered seascape of Galveston’s country-western bars and fleabag hotels, a world of treacherous drifters, pickup trucks, and ashed-out hopes. Any chance that they will find safety there is soon lost. Rocky is a girl with quite a story to tell, one that will pursue and damage Roy for a very long time to come in this powerful and atmospheric thriller, impossible to put down. Constructed with maximum tension and haunting aftereffect, written in darkly beautiful prose, Galveston announces the arrival of a major new literary talent.Show more"	"272"	"June 15, 2010"	"Fiction; Crime; Thriller; Mystery; Noir; Novels; Mystery Thriller"	"New Orleans, Louisiana(United States),Galveston, Texas(United States)"	"Nancy,Cecil,Lance,Roy Cady,Raquel Arceneaux,Tiffany Benoit,Stan Ptitko,Frank Sienkiewicz,Angelo Medeiras,Lou Theriot,Jay Meires,Loraine,Vonda,Sam Gino,Mary-Anne,John Cady,Gary Benoit,Tray Jones,Nonie Elliot,Dehra Elliot,Carmen Lowell"	"9781439166642"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7203669-galveston"

"Existentialism is a Humanism"	"None"	"Jean-Paul Sartre; Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre; Annie Cohen-Solal"	"3.98"	"45,640"	"2,719"	"It was to correct common misconceptions about his thought that Jean-Paul Sartre, the most dominent European intellectual of the post-World War II decades, accepted an invitation to speak on October 29, 1945, at the Club Maintenant in Paris. The unstated objective of his lecture (“Existentialism Is a Humanism”) was to expound his philosophy as a form of “existentialism,” a term much bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was essentially a doctrine for philosophers, though, ironically, he was about to make it accessible to a general audience. The published text of his lecture quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre an international celebrity.The idea of freedom occupies the center of Sartre’s doctrine. Man, born into an empty, godless universe, is nothing to begin with. He creates his essence—his self, his being—through the choices he freely makes (“existence precedes essence”). Were it not for the contingency of his death, he would never end. Choosing to be this or that is to affirm the value of what we choose. In choosing, therefore, we commit not only ourselves but all of mankind.This book presents a new English translation of Sartre’s 1945 lecture and his analysis of Camus’sThe Stranger, along with a discussion of these works by acclaimed Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal. This edition is a translation of the 1996 French edition, which includes Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre’s introduction and a Q&A with Sartre about his lecture.Show more"	"122"	"July 24, 2007"	"Philosophy; Nonfiction; Classics; France; Essays; French Literature; Theory"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780300115468"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51985.Existentialism_is_a_Humanism"

He is regarded as a leading pioneer of existentialism and one of the greatest philosophers of the 19th Century.InFear and Trembling, Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when God commanded him to offer his son as a human sacrifice. Abraham had a choice to complete the task or to forget it. He resigned himself to the loss of his son, acting according to his faith. In other words, one must be willing to give up all his or her earthly possessions in infinite resignation and must also be willing to give up whatever it is that he or she loves more than God. Abraham had passed the test -- his love for God proved greater than anything else in him. And because a good and just Creator would not want a father to kill his son, God intervened at the last moment to prevent the sacrifice.Show more"	"152"	"May 30, 2006"	"Philosophy; Nonfiction; Religion; Classics; Theology; Christianity; Psychology"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780143037576"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24965.Fear_and_Trembling"
"On the Genealogy of Morals"	"None"	"Friedrich Nietzsche; Douglas Smith"	"4.12"	"35,099"	"1,777"	"On the Genealogy of Morals(1887) is a book about the history of ethics and about interpretation. Nietzsche rewrites the former as a history of cruelty, exposing the central values of the Judaeo-Christian and liberal traditions - compassion, equality, justice - as the product of a brutal process of conditioning designed to domesticate the animal vitality of earlier cultures. The result is a book which raises profoundly disquieting issues about the violence of both ethics and interpretation. Nietzsche questions moral certainties by showing that religion and science have no claim to absolute truth, before turning on his own arguments in order to call their very presuppositions into question. The Genealogy is the most sustained of Nietzsche's later works and offers one of the fullest expressions of his characteristic concerns. This edition places his ideas within the cultural context of his own time and stresses the relevance of his work for a contemporary audience.Show more"	"208"	"February 25, 1999"	"Philosophy; Nonfiction; Classics; Psychology; German Literature; History; Religion"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780192836175"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80449.On_the_Genealogy_of_Morals"

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Show more"	"324"	"September 30, 2004"	"Science Fiction; Fiction; Young Adult; Fantasy; Classics; Science Fiction Fantasy; Dystopia"	"Outer Space"	"Dink,Bernard,Valentine Wiggin,Peter Wiggin,Mazer Rackham,Alai,Hyrum Graff,Andrew Wiggin,Petra Arkanian,"Bean",Major Anderson,Bonzo,Major Imbu"	"9780812550702"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game"

"Steve Jobs"	"None"	"Walter Isaacson"	"4.16"	"1,349,831"	"23,482"	"Walter Isaacson's worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.Show more"	"630"	"October 24, 2011"	"Biography; Nonfiction; Business; Technology; Audiobook; History; Biography Memoir"	"San Francisco Bay Area, California(United States),Silicon Valley, California(United States)"	"Steve Jobs"	"9781451648539"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs"

Food is running low and there has been no sign of rescue. But just as the survivors consider deliberately thinning their number, the castle stores are replenished. The sick are healed. And the divine figures of the Constant Lady and her Saints have arrived, despite the barricaded gates, offering succor in return for adoration.Soon, the entire castle is under the sway of their saviors, partaking in intoxicating feasts of terrible origin. The war hero Ser Voyne gives her allegiance to the Constant Lady. Phosyne, a disorganized, paranoid nun-turned-sorceress, races to unravel the mystery of these new visitors and exonerate her experiments as their source. And in the bowels of the castle, a serving girl, Treila, is torn between her thirst for a secret vengeance against Voyne and the desperate need to escape from the horrors that are unfolding within Aymar’s walls.As the castle descends into bacchanalian madness—forgetting the massed army beyond its walls in favor of hedonistic ecstasy—these three women are the only ones to still see their situation for what it is. But they are not immune from the temptations of the castle’s new masters… or each other; and their shifting alliances and entangled pasts bring violence to the surface.

Тя отхвърлила всички предложения да напише продължение на прочутия роман. Но ето, че днес, половин век по-късно, нейната сънародничка Александра Рипли пое предизвикателството и написа продължението на романа.Наследниците на Маргарет Мичъл — нейните племенници Джо и Юджийн, поверили на агенцията „Уилям Морис“ задачата да намери приемник на леля им. След като осъществила контакт със стотици личности от литературния свят, агенцията се спряла на единайсет автори — десет жени и един мъж. Избрали Александра Рипли, авторка на исторически романи и южнякча, родом от Чарлстън, родния град на знаменития Рет Бътлър от „Отнесени от вихъра“. Няколко издатели били упълномощени да прочетат първите петдесет страници от книгата. Клаузите на договора изисквали пълна тайна до внушителната му световна премиера на 25 септември 1991, когато излезе едновременно в четиридесет страни.Рипли започва повествованието там, където го е преустановила Маргарет Мичъл. В романа присъстват същите герои и същите места. И Скарлет е същата — красива, пресметлива, капризна, но все пак малко помъдряла. „Единственото, в което бях сигурна, бе, че, макар и временно, Скарлет отново ще покори Рет Бътлър“, казва авторката.Александра Рипли останала вярна на „Отнесени от вихъра“. Месеци преди да започне работа, писателката препрочела шест пъти знаменития роман, дълго проучвала вестниците и кореспонденциите от времето на Мичъл, дори преписала на ръка 200 страници от романа, за да „усети“ по-добре стила на своята предшественичка.„Не знам дали ще харесат моята книга — казва Рипли, — но във всеки случай съвестта ми е чиста, защото мисля, че не съм измамила никого.“Show more"	"512"	"January 1, 1992"	"Classics; Historical; Novels"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9789544280123"	"Bulgarian"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18209380"

"The Aeneid"	"None"	"Virgil; Scott McGill; Susannah Wright"	"3.87"	"142,221"	"5,568"	"Rome’s epic origin story, brilliantly rendered in a vivid, rhythmic idiom.Crafted during the reign of Augustus Caesar at the outset of the Roman Empire, Virgil’sAeneidis a tale of thrilling adventure, extreme adversity, doomed romance, fateful battles, and profound loss. Through its stirring account of human struggle, meddling gods, and conflicting destinies, the poem brings to life the triumphs and trials that led to one of the most powerful societies the world has ever known. Unlike its Homeric predecessors, which arose from a long oral tradition, theAeneidwas composed by a singular poetic genius, and it has ever since been celebrated as one of the greatest literary achievements of antiquity.This exciting new edition of theAeneid, the first collaborative translation of the poem in English, is rendered in unrhymed iambic pentameter, the English meter that corresponds best, in its history and cultural standing, to Virgil’s dactylic hexameter. Scott McGill and Susannah Wright achieve an ideal middle ground between readability and elevation, engaging modern readers with fresh, contemporary language in a heart-pounding, propulsive rhythm, while also preserving the epic dignity of the original. The result is a brisk, eminently approachable translation that captures Virgil’s sensitive balance between celebrating the Roman Empire and dramatizing its human costs, for victors and vanquished alike. ThisAeneidis a poem in English every bit as complex, inviting, and affecting as the Latin original.With a rich and informative introduction from Emily Wilson, maps drawn especially for this volume, a pronunciation glossary, genealogies, extensive notes, and helpful summaries of each book, this gorgeous edition of Rome’s founding poem will capture the imaginations and stir the souls of a new generation of readers.Show more"	"505"	"August 12, 2025"	"Classics; Poetry; Fiction; Mythology; Literature; School; Fantasy"	"Italy,Troy,Carthage(Tunisia),Sicily(Italy),Rome(Italy)"	"Venus (goddess),Jupiter (God),Aeneas,Juno (Goddess),Priam,Ixion,Iris (Goddess),Mercury (God),Turnus (King of the Rutuli),Vulcan (God),Neoptolemus,Dido of Carthage,Misenus,Anchises,Sybil (Ancient oracle),Ascanius,Charon (mythology),Camilla (mythology),Lavinia (mythology),Pallas (son of Evander)"	"9781324096443"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220450463-the-aeneid"
"The Iliad"	"None"	"Homer; Emily Wilson"	"3.93"	"504,508"	"16,199"	"The greatest literary landmark of antiquity masterfully rendered by the most celebrated translator of our time.When Emily Wilson’s translation of The Odyssey appeared in 2017―revealing the ancient poem in a contemporary idiom that was “fresh, unpretentious and lean” (Madeline Miller, Washington Post)―critics lauded it as “a revelation” (Susan Chira, New York Times) and “a cultural landmark” (Charlotte Higgins, Guardian) that would forever change how Homer is read in English. Now Wilson has returned with an equally revelatory translation of Homer’s other great epic―the most revered war poem of all time.The Iliad roars with the clamor of arms, the bellowing boasts of victors, the fury and grief of loss, and the anguished cries of dying men. It sings, too, of the sublime magnitude of the world―the fierce beauty of nature and the gods’ grand schemes beyond the ken of mortals. In Wilson’s hands, this thrilling, magical, and often horrifying tale now gallops at a pace befitting its legendary battle scenes, in crisp but resonant language that evokes the poem’s deep pathos and reveals palpably real, even “complicated,” characters―both human and divine.The culmination of a decade of intense engagement with antiquity’s most surpassingly beautiful and emotionally complex poetry, Wilson’s Iliad now gives us a complete Homer for our generation.Show more"	"848"	"September 26, 2023"	"Classics; Poetry; Fiction; Mythology; Literature; Fantasy; Greek Mythology"	"Τροία,Troy,Greece,Ancient Greece(Greece),Aegean Sea(Greece)"	"Odysseus,Menelaus,Paris,Hector of Troy,Aeneas,Sarpedon (King of Lycia),Priam,Patroclus,Diomedes,Ajax Oileus,Andromache,Briseis,Hecuba,Nestor,Akhilleus,Achilles,Cassandra,Agamemnon,Ajax,Helen of Troy,Odysseus,Menelaus,Hector of Troy,Patroclus,Agamemnon,Paris,Cassandra,Andromache,Priam,Helen of Troy,Briseis"	"9781324001805"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77265004-the-iliad"

"The Plague"	"None"	"Albert Camus; Stuart Gilbert"	"4.02"	"310,095"	"19,485"	"The Plague is a novel by Albert Camus, published in 1947.It tells the story from the point of view of a narrator of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran. The narrator remains unknown until the start of the last chapter, chapter 5 of part 5. The novel presents a snapshot of life in Oran as seen through the author's distinctive absurdist point of view.The book tells a gripping tale of human unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind confronts death, The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral resonance, profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.The Plague is considered an existentialist classic despite Camus' objection to the label. The novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their destinies. The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial, whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings; the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.Show more"	"308"	"March 1, 1991"	"Classics; Fiction; Philosophy; France; Literature; French Literature; Novels"	"Oran(Algeria),Algeria,North Africa"	"Raoul,Dr Bernard Rieux,Father Paneloux,Joseph Grand,Raymond Rambert,Jean Tarrou,Cottard,M.

"F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today.The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**kis his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**kis a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.Show more"	"212"	"September 13, 2016"	"Nonfiction; Self Help; Psychology; Audiobook; Personal Development; Philosophy; Business"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9798804636129"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck"

In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things.Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.Show more"	"195"	"September 16, 2014"	"Business; Nonfiction; Entrepreneurship; Startup; Self Help; Economics; Technology"	"Unknown"	"Elon Musk,Peter Thiel,Max Levchin"	"9780804139298"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050143-zero-to-one"

The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched.Eric Ries defines a startup asan organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on "validated learning," rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want.

Its truths are so enduring that its language has become part of the common Russian speech.One hot spring, the devil arrives in Moscow, accompanied by a retinue that includes a beautiful naked witch and an immense talking black cat with a fondness for chess and vodka.

And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving—and human—figures in world literature.Tolstoy gave his personal approval to this translation, published here in a new single volume edition, which includes an introduction by Henry Gifford, and Tolstoy's important essay `Some Words about War and Peace'.Show more"	"1392"	"June 25, 1998"	"Classics; Fiction; Historical Fiction; Russia; Russian Literature; Literature; War"	"Russia,St. Petersburg, Russia,Moscow(Russian Federation)"	"Pierre Bezukhov,Natasha Rostova,Nikolai Rostov,Ilya Rostov,Petya Rostov,Helene Kuragina,Anna Scherer,Lise Bolkonskaya,Platon Karataev,Vasili Denisov,Anna Drubetskaya,Nikolai Bolkonsky,Mikhail Kutuzov,Vera Rostova,Prince Andrey Bokonsky,Boris Drubetskoy,Sonya Rostova,Anatole Kuragin,Mademoiselle Bourienne,Maria Bolkonskaya,Fedja Dolochov,Adolf Berg,Osip Basdeev"	"9780192833983"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/656.War_and_Peace"

This comprehensive review gives you a complete overview of the plot, key characters, and the author's writing style, both good and bad.Infernonavigates topics such as human overpopulation and social responsibility while Langdon tries to make sense of his visions and come to terms with the feeling that he is the only person who can save the world. In this review, you'll also find critical opinions of the novel as well as an evaluation of the novel's high and low points. Fans of Dan Brown won't be disappointed by this offering, as it has all the trappings of his previous works. Conversely, while the action will keep readers turning pages, some may find his prose weak, as his storytelling relies heavily on his common tropes. Nevertheless, Brown's fourth Robert Langdon novel has plenty to offer.Show more"	"Kindle"	"January 13, 2014"	"Thriller; Fiction; Novels; Mystery"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20743999-inferno"

Tragic heiress, former tabloid princess, and daughter of one of the most storied (and scandalous) families of the 20th Century.When Margaret invites them both for a one-month trial period, after which she’ll choose the person who’ll tell her story, there are three things keeping Alice’s head in the game.One: Alice genuinely likes people, which means people usually like Alice—and she has a whole month to win the legendary woman over.Two: She’s ready for this job and the chance to impress her perennially unimpressed family with a Serious PublicationThree: Hayden Anderson, who should have no reason to be concerned about losing this book, is glowering at her in a shaken-to-the core way that suggests he sees her as competition.But the problem is, Margaret is only giving each of them pieces of her story. Pieces they can’t swap to put together because of an ironclad NDA and an inconvenient yearning pulsing between them every time they’re in the same room.And it’s becoming abundantly clear that their story—just like the tale Margaret’s spinning—could be a mystery, tragedy, or love ballad…depending on who’s telling it.Show more"	"432"	"April 22, 2025"	"Romance; Fiction; Audiobook; Contemporary; Book Club; Contemporary Romance; Adult"	"Little Crescent Island, Georgia(United States),Georgia(United States)"	"Alice Scott,Hayden Anderson,Margaret Ives"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218559595-great-big-beautiful-life"

Pomerans"	"4.08"	"110,326"	"825"	"A new selection of post-impressionist painter Vincent Van Gough's letters,The Letters of Vincent van Goghput a human face on one of the most haunting figures in modern Western culture. In this Penguin Classics edition, the letters are selected and edited by Ronald de Leeuw, and translated by Arnold Pomerans in Penguin Classics.Few artists' letters are as self-revelatory as Vincent van Gogh's, and this selection, spanning his artistic career, sheds light on every facet of the life and work of this complex and tortured man. Engaging candidly and movingly with his religious struggles, his ill-fated search for love, his attacks of mental illness and his relation with his brother Theo, the letters contradict the popular myth of van Gogh as an anti-social madman and a martyr to art, showing instead a man of great emotional and spiritual depths. Above all, they stand as an intense personal narrative of artistic development and a unique account of the process of creation.The letters are linked by explanatory biographical passages, revealing van Gogh's inner journey as well as the outer facts of his life. This edition also includes the drawings that originally illustrated the letters.Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853-1890) was born in Holland. In 1885 he painted his first masterpiece,The Potato Eaters,a haunting scene of domestic poverty. A year later he began studying in Paris, where he met Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Seurat, who became very important influences on his work. In 1888 he left Paris for the Provencal landscape at Arles, the subject of many of his best works, includingSunflowers.If you enjoyedThe Letters of Vincent van Gogh, you might also like100 Artists Manifestos, available in Penguin Modern Classics.'If there was ever any doubt that Van Gogh's letters belong beside those great classics of artistic self-revelation, Cellini's autobiography and Delacroix's journal, this excellent new edition dispels it'The TimesShow more"	"528"	"March 1, 1998"	"Art; Nonfiction; Classics; Biography; History; Art History; Memoir"	"Brabant(Belgium),London, England,Antwerp(Belgium),Arles(France),Saint-Remy(France),Auvers(France),The Hague(Netherlands),Belgium,France,Netherlands"	"Unknown"	"9780140446746"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395233.The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh"

Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.Show more"	"512"	"January 1, 2015"	"Nonfiction; History; Science; Audiobook; Philosophy; Anthropology; Psychology"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens"

We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren's Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation's largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death. At its core, "The Power of Habit" contains an exhilarating the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.

"The Psychology of Money"	"None"	"Morgan Housel"	"4.29"	"306,792"	"19,878"	"Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money--investing, personal finance, and business decisions--is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life's most important topics.Show more"	"242"	"September 8, 2020"	"Finance; Nonfiction; Psychology; Self Help; Business; Money; Personal Finance"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780857197689"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money"

Barnum.Some laws teach the need for prudence (“Law 1: Never Outshine the Master”), others teach the value of confidence (“Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness”), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (“Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally”). Every law, though, has one thing in common: an interest in total domination. In a bold and arresting two-color package,The 48 Laws of Poweris ideal whether your aim is conquest, self-defense, or simply to understand the rules of the game.Show more"	"452"	"September 1, 2000"	"Nonfiction; Psychology; Self Help; Business; Philosophy; Personal Development; History"	"Unknown"	"Xerxes I of Persia,Oedipus,Cardinal Richelieu,Charles Darwin,Aristotle (philosopher),Moses,Oliver Cromwell,Leo Tolstoy,Alexander the Great,Richard Nixon,Richard Wagner,Henry David Thoreau,Galileo Galilei,Themistocles,Hideyoshi Toyotomi,Arthur Schopenhauer,Andy Warhol,Oscar Wilde,Maximilien Robespierre,Muhammad Ali,Louis XIV of France,Constantine the Great,Odysseus,Thucydides,Christopher Columbus,Grigori Rasputin,Dante Alighieri,George Sand,Pablo Picasso,Genghis Khan,Ivan the Terrible,Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,Benito Mussolini,Friedrich Nietzsche,Henry Kissinger,Cosimo II de'Medici, Duke of Tuscany,Dwight D.
