Peter Jackson's "fierce, imaginative movie takes high-flying risks and inspires with its power and scale," wrote Newsweek. "In every way this is moviemaking on a grand scale," wrote the San Francisco Chronicle, while Time proclaimed the "grandeur, moral heft and emotional depth" of the film, which received thirteen Academy Award(R) nominations. Including more than 300 photographs from all three films, most unique to this book, and exclusive interviews with all the cast and crew, Brian Sibley's fascinating book takes every fan inside the process of adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork for the screen. For the first time in history, three major movies were made at the same time, a triumphant and monumental undertaking that took the world by storm. Here can be found details about the hundreds of dedicated artists, craftspeople and cast and crew members who labored for years -- adding authenticity at every stage -- to bring one of the greatest stories ever told to an eager film audience. Sibley takes us inside the process of filmmaking to show us how the magic is made -- from the director, writers and actors to wardrobe, makeup, miniatures, music and digital special effects, it's all here."It was tiring, physically and mentally, but never dull. Three movies, one big story, and so much variety: one day shooting scenes of intimate heart-wrenching drama, the next, vast battle scenes involving hundreds of extras. Every day brought an opportunity to create something new on this enormous canvas that is The Lord of the Rings." -- Peter JacksonShow more","192","January 1, 2002","Nonfiction; Film; Art; Media Tie In; Reference; Science Fiction Fantasy; Classics","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7351.The_Lord_of_the_Rings"

Rowling, a successful writer of previous four books about a young wizard that enchanted the hearts of both the young and the grown-ups. Maybe the most important thing about this sequel is that it is the longest book of all seven, with its thirty-eight chapters and more than seven hundred pages (total number of pages varies according to the country; Swedish has, for example a thousand pages while UK version has seven hundred sixty six).Similar to the last four books, this one also revolves around young wizard named Harry Potter, his life in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his coming of age, relationship with his friends Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, but difference is that this book revolves more around Harry’s relationship with his godfather Sirius Black, introduced in the third book- Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.Also, the fifth book is somewhat more ‘mature’ and more ‘sinister’, because here readers learn that lord Voldemort (evil sorcerer and the nemesis of Harry) has indeed returned, along with his followers called ‘’Death Eaters’’ and that he has taken physical form and that the events that will happen because of their actions will be the core of the story.Click the Buy Now With One Click Button, and learn everything about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix .Harry potter and the order of phoenix, harry potter book 5, harry potter series kindle edition book 1-7, harry potter kindle free series, harry potter and the order of phoenix freeShow more","28","July 4, 2015","Fantasy; Harry Potter","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25857197-harry-potter-and-the-order-of-phoenix"
