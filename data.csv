The Hunger Games have begun. . . .In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.Show more"	"374"	"September 14, 2008"	"Young Adult; Dystopia; Fiction; Fantasy; Science Fiction; Romance; Adventure"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games"

Today its message has grown more relevant than ever before.Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.Show more"	"194"	"December 6, 2011"	"Classics; Fiction; Science Fiction; Dystopia; School; Literature; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Guy Montag,Clarisse McClellan,Mildred Montag,Captain Beatty,Professor Faber,The Mechanical Hound"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13079982-fahrenheit-451"

At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”Show more"	"182"	"October 1, 1999"	"Classics; Fiction; Young Adult; School; Dystopia; Literature; Read For School"	"Unknown"	"Ralph,Piggy,Roger,Jack Merridew,Simon"	"9780140283334"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies"

But George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own.While the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composingOf Mice and Men, creating an intimate portrait of two men facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and callousness.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another.

A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world—until the unthinkable happens.InWhere the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens’s debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman, who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group. The clues to the mystery are brushed into the lush habitat and natural histories of its wild creatures.Show more"	"384"	"August 14, 2018"	"Fiction; Book Club; Historical Fiction; Mystery; Romance; Audiobook; Contemporary"	"North Carolina(United States, 1952)"	"Kya Clark,Chase Andrews,Tate Walker"	"9780735219113"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36809135-where-the-crawdads-sing"

Known “without affection” to members of the boss’s crew as “Big Country” on account of his long hair, beard, and cowboy boots, Roy is alert to the possibility that a routine assignment could be a deathtrap. Which it is. Yet what the would-be killers do to Roy Cady is not the same as what he does to them, which is to say that after a smoking spasm of violence, they are mostly dead and he is mostly alive. Before Roy makes his getaway, he realizes there are two women in the apartment, one of them still breathing, and he sees something in her frightened, defiant eyes that causes a fateful decision. He takes her with him as he goes on the run from New Orleans to Galveston, Texas—an action as ill-advised as it is inescapable. The girl’s name is Rocky, and she is too young, too tough, too sexy—and far too much trouble. Roy, Rocky, and her sister hide in the battered seascape of Galveston’s country-western bars and fleabag hotels, a world of treacherous drifters, pickup trucks, and ashed-out hopes. Any chance that they will find safety there is soon lost. Rocky is a girl with quite a story to tell, one that will pursue and damage Roy for a very long time to come in this powerful and atmospheric thriller, impossible to put down. Constructed with maximum tension and haunting aftereffect, written in darkly beautiful prose, Galveston announces the arrival of a major new literary talent.Show more"	"272"	"June 15, 2010"	"Fiction; Crime; Thriller; Mystery; Noir; Novels; Mystery Thriller"	"New Orleans, Louisiana(United States),Galveston, Texas(United States)"	"Nancy,Cecil,Lance,Roy Cady,Raquel Arceneaux,Tiffany Benoit,Stan Ptitko,Frank Sienkiewicz,Angelo Medeiras,Lou Theriot,Jay Meires,Loraine,Vonda,Sam Gino,Mary-Anne,John Cady,Gary Benoit,Tray Jones,Nonie Elliot,Dehra Elliot,Carmen Lowell"	"9781439166642"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7203669-galveston"

"Existentialism is a Humanism"	"None"	"Jean-Paul Sartre; Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre; Annie Cohen-Solal"	"3.98"	"45,640"	"2,719"	"It was to correct common misconceptions about his thought that Jean-Paul Sartre, the most dominent European intellectual of the post-World War II decades, accepted an invitation to speak on October 29, 1945, at the Club Maintenant in Paris. The unstated objective of his lecture (“Existentialism Is a Humanism”) was to expound his philosophy as a form of “existentialism,” a term much bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was essentially a doctrine for philosophers, though, ironically, he was about to make it accessible to a general audience. The published text of his lecture quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre an international celebrity.The idea of freedom occupies the center of Sartre’s doctrine. Man, born into an empty, godless universe, is nothing to begin with. He creates his essence—his self, his being—through the choices he freely makes (“existence precedes essence”). Were it not for the contingency of his death, he would never end. Choosing to be this or that is to affirm the value of what we choose. In choosing, therefore, we commit not only ourselves but all of mankind.This book presents a new English translation of Sartre’s 1945 lecture and his analysis of Camus’sThe Stranger, along with a discussion of these works by acclaimed Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal. This edition is a translation of the 1996 French edition, which includes Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre’s introduction and a Q&A with Sartre about his lecture.Show more"	"122"	"July 24, 2007"	"Philosophy; Nonfiction; Classics; France; Essays; French Literature; Theory"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780300115468"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51985.Existentialism_is_a_Humanism"

He is regarded as a leading pioneer of existentialism and one of the greatest philosophers of the 19th Century.InFear and Trembling, Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when God commanded him to offer his son as a human sacrifice. Abraham had a choice to complete the task or to forget it. He resigned himself to the loss of his son, acting according to his faith. In other words, one must be willing to give up all his or her earthly possessions in infinite resignation and must also be willing to give up whatever it is that he or she loves more than God. Abraham had passed the test -- his love for God proved greater than anything else in him. And because a good and just Creator would not want a father to kill his son, God intervened at the last moment to prevent the sacrifice.Show more"	"152"	"May 30, 2006"	"Philosophy; Nonfiction; Religion; Classics; Theology; Christianity; Psychology"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780143037576"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24965.Fear_and_Trembling"
"On the Genealogy of Morals"	"None"	"Friedrich Nietzsche; Douglas Smith"	"4.12"	"35,099"	"1,777"	"On the Genealogy of Morals(1887) is a book about the history of ethics and about interpretation. Nietzsche rewrites the former as a history of cruelty, exposing the central values of the Judaeo-Christian and liberal traditions - compassion, equality, justice - as the product of a brutal process of conditioning designed to domesticate the animal vitality of earlier cultures. The result is a book which raises profoundly disquieting issues about the violence of both ethics and interpretation. Nietzsche questions moral certainties by showing that religion and science have no claim to absolute truth, before turning on his own arguments in order to call their very presuppositions into question. The Genealogy is the most sustained of Nietzsche's later works and offers one of the fullest expressions of his characteristic concerns. This edition places his ideas within the cultural context of his own time and stresses the relevance of his work for a contemporary audience.Show more"	"208"	"February 25, 1999"	"Philosophy; Nonfiction; Classics; Psychology; German Literature; History; Religion"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780192836175"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80449.On_the_Genealogy_of_Morals"

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Show more"	"324"	"September 30, 2004"	"Science Fiction; Fiction; Young Adult; Fantasy; Classics; Science Fiction Fantasy; Dystopia"	"Outer Space"	"Dink,Bernard,Valentine Wiggin,Peter Wiggin,Mazer Rackham,Alai,Hyrum Graff,Andrew Wiggin,Petra Arkanian,"Bean",Major Anderson,Bonzo,Major Imbu"	"9780812550702"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game"

"Steve Jobs"	"None"	"Walter Isaacson"	"4.16"	"1,349,831"	"23,482"	"Walter Isaacson's worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.Show more"	"630"	"October 24, 2011"	"Biography; Nonfiction; Business; Technology; Audiobook; History; Biography Memoir"	"San Francisco Bay Area, California(United States),Silicon Valley, California(United States)"	"Steve Jobs"	"9781451648539"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs"

Food is running low and there has been no sign of rescue. But just as the survivors consider deliberately thinning their number, the castle stores are replenished. The sick are healed. And the divine figures of the Constant Lady and her Saints have arrived, despite the barricaded gates, offering succor in return for adoration.Soon, the entire castle is under the sway of their saviors, partaking in intoxicating feasts of terrible origin. The war hero Ser Voyne gives her allegiance to the Constant Lady. Phosyne, a disorganized, paranoid nun-turned-sorceress, races to unravel the mystery of these new visitors and exonerate her experiments as their source. And in the bowels of the castle, a serving girl, Treila, is torn between her thirst for a secret vengeance against Voyne and the desperate need to escape from the horrors that are unfolding within Aymar’s walls.As the castle descends into bacchanalian madness—forgetting the massed army beyond its walls in favor of hedonistic ecstasy—these three women are the only ones to still see their situation for what it is. But they are not immune from the temptations of the castle’s new masters… or each other; and their shifting alliances and entangled pasts bring violence to the surface.

Тя отхвърлила всички предложения да напише продължение на прочутия роман. Но ето, че днес, половин век по-късно, нейната сънародничка Александра Рипли пое предизвикателството и написа продължението на романа.Наследниците на Маргарет Мичъл — нейните племенници Джо и Юджийн, поверили на агенцията „Уилям Морис“ задачата да намери приемник на леля им. След като осъществила контакт със стотици личности от литературния свят, агенцията се спряла на единайсет автори — десет жени и един мъж. Избрали Александра Рипли, авторка на исторически романи и южнякча, родом от Чарлстън, родния град на знаменития Рет Бътлър от „Отнесени от вихъра“. Няколко издатели били упълномощени да прочетат първите петдесет страници от книгата. Клаузите на договора изисквали пълна тайна до внушителната му световна премиера на 25 септември 1991, когато излезе едновременно в четиридесет страни.Рипли започва повествованието там, където го е преустановила Маргарет Мичъл. В романа присъстват същите герои и същите места. И Скарлет е същата — красива, пресметлива, капризна, но все пак малко помъдряла. „Единственото, в което бях сигурна, бе, че, макар и временно, Скарлет отново ще покори Рет Бътлър“, казва авторката.Александра Рипли останала вярна на „Отнесени от вихъра“. Месеци преди да започне работа, писателката препрочела шест пъти знаменития роман, дълго проучвала вестниците и кореспонденциите от времето на Мичъл, дори преписала на ръка 200 страници от романа, за да „усети“ по-добре стила на своята предшественичка.„Не знам дали ще харесат моята книга — казва Рипли, — но във всеки случай съвестта ми е чиста, защото мисля, че не съм измамила никого.“Show more"	"512"	"January 1, 1992"	"Classics; Historical; Novels"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9789544280123"	"Bulgarian"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18209380"

"The Aeneid"	"None"	"Virgil; Scott McGill; Susannah Wright"	"3.87"	"142,221"	"5,568"	"Rome’s epic origin story, brilliantly rendered in a vivid, rhythmic idiom.Crafted during the reign of Augustus Caesar at the outset of the Roman Empire, Virgil’sAeneidis a tale of thrilling adventure, extreme adversity, doomed romance, fateful battles, and profound loss. Through its stirring account of human struggle, meddling gods, and conflicting destinies, the poem brings to life the triumphs and trials that led to one of the most powerful societies the world has ever known. Unlike its Homeric predecessors, which arose from a long oral tradition, theAeneidwas composed by a singular poetic genius, and it has ever since been celebrated as one of the greatest literary achievements of antiquity.This exciting new edition of theAeneid, the first collaborative translation of the poem in English, is rendered in unrhymed iambic pentameter, the English meter that corresponds best, in its history and cultural standing, to Virgil’s dactylic hexameter. Scott McGill and Susannah Wright achieve an ideal middle ground between readability and elevation, engaging modern readers with fresh, contemporary language in a heart-pounding, propulsive rhythm, while also preserving the epic dignity of the original. The result is a brisk, eminently approachable translation that captures Virgil’s sensitive balance between celebrating the Roman Empire and dramatizing its human costs, for victors and vanquished alike. ThisAeneidis a poem in English every bit as complex, inviting, and affecting as the Latin original.With a rich and informative introduction from Emily Wilson, maps drawn especially for this volume, a pronunciation glossary, genealogies, extensive notes, and helpful summaries of each book, this gorgeous edition of Rome’s founding poem will capture the imaginations and stir the souls of a new generation of readers.Show more"	"505"	"August 12, 2025"	"Classics; Poetry; Fiction; Mythology; Literature; School; Fantasy"	"Italy,Troy,Carthage(Tunisia),Sicily(Italy),Rome(Italy)"	"Venus (goddess),Jupiter (God),Aeneas,Juno (Goddess),Priam,Ixion,Iris (Goddess),Mercury (God),Turnus (King of the Rutuli),Vulcan (God),Neoptolemus,Dido of Carthage,Misenus,Anchises,Sybil (Ancient oracle),Ascanius,Charon (mythology),Camilla (mythology),Lavinia (mythology),Pallas (son of Evander)"	"9781324096443"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220450463-the-aeneid"
"The Iliad"	"None"	"Homer; Emily Wilson"	"3.93"	"504,508"	"16,199"	"The greatest literary landmark of antiquity masterfully rendered by the most celebrated translator of our time.When Emily Wilson’s translation of The Odyssey appeared in 2017―revealing the ancient poem in a contemporary idiom that was “fresh, unpretentious and lean” (Madeline Miller, Washington Post)―critics lauded it as “a revelation” (Susan Chira, New York Times) and “a cultural landmark” (Charlotte Higgins, Guardian) that would forever change how Homer is read in English. Now Wilson has returned with an equally revelatory translation of Homer’s other great epic―the most revered war poem of all time.The Iliad roars with the clamor of arms, the bellowing boasts of victors, the fury and grief of loss, and the anguished cries of dying men. It sings, too, of the sublime magnitude of the world―the fierce beauty of nature and the gods’ grand schemes beyond the ken of mortals. In Wilson’s hands, this thrilling, magical, and often horrifying tale now gallops at a pace befitting its legendary battle scenes, in crisp but resonant language that evokes the poem’s deep pathos and reveals palpably real, even “complicated,” characters―both human and divine.The culmination of a decade of intense engagement with antiquity’s most surpassingly beautiful and emotionally complex poetry, Wilson’s Iliad now gives us a complete Homer for our generation.Show more"	"848"	"September 26, 2023"	"Classics; Poetry; Fiction; Mythology; Literature; Fantasy; Greek Mythology"	"Τροία,Troy,Greece,Ancient Greece(Greece),Aegean Sea(Greece)"	"Odysseus,Menelaus,Paris,Hector of Troy,Aeneas,Sarpedon (King of Lycia),Priam,Patroclus,Diomedes,Ajax Oileus,Andromache,Briseis,Hecuba,Nestor,Akhilleus,Achilles,Cassandra,Agamemnon,Ajax,Helen of Troy,Odysseus,Menelaus,Hector of Troy,Patroclus,Agamemnon,Paris,Cassandra,Andromache,Priam,Helen of Troy,Briseis"	"9781324001805"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77265004-the-iliad"

"The Plague"	"None"	"Albert Camus; Stuart Gilbert"	"4.02"	"310,095"	"19,485"	"The Plague is a novel by Albert Camus, published in 1947.It tells the story from the point of view of a narrator of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran. The narrator remains unknown until the start of the last chapter, chapter 5 of part 5. The novel presents a snapshot of life in Oran as seen through the author's distinctive absurdist point of view.The book tells a gripping tale of human unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind confronts death, The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral resonance, profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.The Plague is considered an existentialist classic despite Camus' objection to the label. The novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their destinies. The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial, whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings; the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.Show more"	"308"	"March 1, 1991"	"Classics; Fiction; Philosophy; France; Literature; French Literature; Novels"	"Oran(Algeria),Algeria,North Africa"	"Raoul,Dr Bernard Rieux,Father Paneloux,Joseph Grand,Raymond Rambert,Jean Tarrou,Cottard,M.

"F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today.The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**kis his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**kis a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.Show more"	"212"	"September 13, 2016"	"Nonfiction; Self Help; Psychology; Audiobook; Personal Development; Philosophy; Business"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9798804636129"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck"

In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things.Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.Show more"	"195"	"September 16, 2014"	"Business; Nonfiction; Entrepreneurship; Startup; Self Help; Economics; Technology"	"Unknown"	"Elon Musk,Peter Thiel,Max Levchin"	"9780804139298"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050143-zero-to-one"

The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched.Eric Ries defines a startup asan organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on "validated learning," rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want.

Its truths are so enduring that its language has become part of the common Russian speech.One hot spring, the devil arrives in Moscow, accompanied by a retinue that includes a beautiful naked witch and an immense talking black cat with a fondness for chess and vodka.

And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving—and human—figures in world literature.Tolstoy gave his personal approval to this translation, published here in a new single volume edition, which includes an introduction by Henry Gifford, and Tolstoy's important essay `Some Words about War and Peace'.Show more"	"1392"	"June 25, 1998"	"Classics; Fiction; Historical Fiction; Russia; Russian Literature; Literature; War"	"Russia,St. Petersburg, Russia,Moscow(Russian Federation)"	"Pierre Bezukhov,Natasha Rostova,Nikolai Rostov,Ilya Rostov,Petya Rostov,Helene Kuragina,Anna Scherer,Lise Bolkonskaya,Platon Karataev,Vasili Denisov,Anna Drubetskaya,Nikolai Bolkonsky,Mikhail Kutuzov,Vera Rostova,Prince Andrey Bokonsky,Boris Drubetskoy,Sonya Rostova,Anatole Kuragin,Mademoiselle Bourienne,Maria Bolkonskaya,Fedja Dolochov,Adolf Berg,Osip Basdeev"	"9780192833983"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/656.War_and_Peace"

This comprehensive review gives you a complete overview of the plot, key characters, and the author's writing style, both good and bad.Infernonavigates topics such as human overpopulation and social responsibility while Langdon tries to make sense of his visions and come to terms with the feeling that he is the only person who can save the world. In this review, you'll also find critical opinions of the novel as well as an evaluation of the novel's high and low points. Fans of Dan Brown won't be disappointed by this offering, as it has all the trappings of his previous works. Conversely, while the action will keep readers turning pages, some may find his prose weak, as his storytelling relies heavily on his common tropes. Nevertheless, Brown's fourth Robert Langdon novel has plenty to offer.Show more"	"Kindle"	"January 13, 2014"	"Thriller; Fiction; Novels; Mystery"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20743999-inferno"

Tragic heiress, former tabloid princess, and daughter of one of the most storied (and scandalous) families of the 20th Century.When Margaret invites them both for a one-month trial period, after which she’ll choose the person who’ll tell her story, there are three things keeping Alice’s head in the game.One: Alice genuinely likes people, which means people usually like Alice—and she has a whole month to win the legendary woman over.Two: She’s ready for this job and the chance to impress her perennially unimpressed family with a Serious PublicationThree: Hayden Anderson, who should have no reason to be concerned about losing this book, is glowering at her in a shaken-to-the core way that suggests he sees her as competition.But the problem is, Margaret is only giving each of them pieces of her story. Pieces they can’t swap to put together because of an ironclad NDA and an inconvenient yearning pulsing between them every time they’re in the same room.And it’s becoming abundantly clear that their story—just like the tale Margaret’s spinning—could be a mystery, tragedy, or love ballad…depending on who’s telling it.Show more"	"432"	"April 22, 2025"	"Romance; Fiction; Audiobook; Contemporary; Book Club; Contemporary Romance; Adult"	"Little Crescent Island, Georgia(United States),Georgia(United States)"	"Alice Scott,Hayden Anderson,Margaret Ives"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218559595-great-big-beautiful-life"

Pomerans"	"4.08"	"110,326"	"825"	"A new selection of post-impressionist painter Vincent Van Gough's letters,The Letters of Vincent van Goghput a human face on one of the most haunting figures in modern Western culture. In this Penguin Classics edition, the letters are selected and edited by Ronald de Leeuw, and translated by Arnold Pomerans in Penguin Classics.Few artists' letters are as self-revelatory as Vincent van Gogh's, and this selection, spanning his artistic career, sheds light on every facet of the life and work of this complex and tortured man. Engaging candidly and movingly with his religious struggles, his ill-fated search for love, his attacks of mental illness and his relation with his brother Theo, the letters contradict the popular myth of van Gogh as an anti-social madman and a martyr to art, showing instead a man of great emotional and spiritual depths. Above all, they stand as an intense personal narrative of artistic development and a unique account of the process of creation.The letters are linked by explanatory biographical passages, revealing van Gogh's inner journey as well as the outer facts of his life. This edition also includes the drawings that originally illustrated the letters.Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853-1890) was born in Holland. In 1885 he painted his first masterpiece,The Potato Eaters,a haunting scene of domestic poverty. A year later he began studying in Paris, where he met Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Seurat, who became very important influences on his work. In 1888 he left Paris for the Provencal landscape at Arles, the subject of many of his best works, includingSunflowers.If you enjoyedThe Letters of Vincent van Gogh, you might also like100 Artists Manifestos, available in Penguin Modern Classics.'If there was ever any doubt that Van Gogh's letters belong beside those great classics of artistic self-revelation, Cellini's autobiography and Delacroix's journal, this excellent new edition dispels it'The TimesShow more"	"528"	"March 1, 1998"	"Art; Nonfiction; Classics; Biography; History; Art History; Memoir"	"Brabant(Belgium),London, England,Antwerp(Belgium),Arles(France),Saint-Remy(France),Auvers(France),The Hague(Netherlands),Belgium,France,Netherlands"	"Unknown"	"9780140446746"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395233.The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh"

Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.Show more"	"512"	"January 1, 2015"	"Nonfiction; History; Science; Audiobook; Philosophy; Anthropology; Psychology"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens"

We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren's Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation's largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death. At its core, "The Power of Habit" contains an exhilarating the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.

And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money--investing, personal finance, and business decisions--is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life's most important topics.Show more"	"242"	"September 8, 2020"	"Finance; Nonfiction; Psychology; Self Help; Business; Money; Personal Finance"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780857197689"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money"

Barnum.Some laws teach the need for prudence (“Law 1: Never Outshine the Master”), others teach the value of confidence (“Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness”), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (“Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally”).

"Slaughterhouse-Five"	"None"	"Kurt Vonnegut Jr."	"4.10"	"1,471,628"	"48,428"	"Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.”An instant bestseller,Slaughterhouse-Fivemade Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it.Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.Show more"	"275"	"January 12, 1999"	"Classics; Fiction; Science Fiction; Historical Fiction; War; Literature; Novels"	"Dresden(Germany, 1945),Tralfamadore,Ilium(United States),Germany,The United States of America"	"Billy Pilgrim,Kilgore Trout,Eliot Rosewater,Roland Weary,Paul Lazzaro,Edgar Derby,Robert Pilgrim,Valencia Merble,Barbara Pilgrim,Howard W.

In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be foundhereShow more"	"451"	"January 1, 2009"	"Fiction; Historical Fiction; Book Club; Historical; Classics; Adult; Adult Fiction"	"Jackson, Mississippi(United States, 1962),Mississippi(United States),The United States of America"	"Eugenia “Skeeter” Phelan,Aibileen Clark,Minny Jackson,Hilly Holbrook,Elizabeth Leefolt,Celia Foote,Stuart Whitworth,Johnny Foote,Mae Mobley Leefolt"	"9780399155345"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4667024-the-help"

Armani! Versace! at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child.THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about “The Boss from Hell.” Narrated in Andrea’s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda’s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.Show more"	"432"	"May 30, 2006"	"Fiction; Chick Lit; Contemporary; Romance; Humor; Adult; Adult Fiction"	"New York City, New York(United States)"	"Andrea Sachs,Miranda Priestly,Alexander Fineman,Emily,Lily Goodwin"	"9780307275554"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5139.The_Devil_Wears_Prada"

The Handmaid's Tale is an instant classic and eerily prescient cultural phenomenon, from "the patron saint of feminist dystopian fiction" ( New York Times ) The Handmaid’s Tale is a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast. Set in the near future, it describes life in what was once the United States and is now called the Republic of Gilead, a monotheocracy that has reacted to social unrest and a sharply declining birthrate by reverting to, and going beyond, the repressive intolerance of the original Puritans. The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men in its population. The story is told through the eyes of Offred, one of the unfortunate Handmaids under the new social order. In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment’s calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions. The Handmaid’s Tale is funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing. It is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and a tour de force. It is Margaret Atwood at her best.Show more"	"320"	"April 25, 2017"	"Fiction; Classics; Dystopia; Science Fiction; Feminism; Book Club; Fantasy"	"Republic of Gilead(, 2005),The United States of America,Bangor, Maine(United States)"	"The Commander,Offred,Serena Joy,Ofglen,Moira,Aunt Lydia,Nick (The Handmaid's Tale),Janine (The Handmaid's Tale)"	"9781328879943"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34454589-the-handmaid-s-tale"

These lost souls find in each other a reason to get up each morning, a reason to dream, a reason to love.Out of that summer emerges a transcendent work of art, a painting that will unexpectedly be placed into eighteen-year-old Louisa’s care. She embarks on a surprise-filled cross-country journey to learn how the painting came to be and to decide what to do with it. The closer she gets to the painting’s birthplace, the more nervous she becomes about what she’ll find. Louisa is proof that happy endings don’t always take the form we expect in this stunning testament to the transformative, timeless power of friendship and art.Show more"	"448"	"May 6, 2025"	"Fiction; Book Club; Audiobook; Contemporary; Literary Fiction; Coming Of Age; Adult"	"Sweden"	"Unknown"	"9781982112820"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217163697-my-friends"

"Into the Wild"	"None"	"Jon Krakauer"	"4.02"	"1,182,233"	"32,844"	"Krakauer’s page-turning bestseller explores a famed missing person mystery while unraveling the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination; the allure of high-risk activities to young men of a certain cast of mind; the complex, charged bond between fathers and sons."Terrifying... Eloquent... A heart-rending drama of human yearning." —New York TimesIn April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter. How Christopher Johnson McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.Jon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless's short life. Admitting an interst that borders on obsession, he searches for the clues to the drives and desires that propelled McCandless.When McCandless's innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversible and fatal, he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naiveté, pretensions, and hubris. He is said to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless's uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows, and the peril, adversity, and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding--and not an ounce of sentimentality. Mesmerizing, heartbreaking, Into the Wild is a tour de force. The power and luminosity of Jon Krakauer's stoytelling blaze through every page.Show more"	"217"	"January 1, 2015"	"Nonfiction; Biography; Adventure; Travel; Classics; Memoir; Nature"	"Mexico,Virginia(United States),The Slabs, Mojave Desert, California(United States),Alaska(United States, 1992),Stampede Trail, Alaska(United States, 1992)"	"Christopher McCandless"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60869516-into-the-wild"

"Eat, Pray, Love"	"None"	"Elizabeth Gilbert"	"3.64"	"1,834,654"	"60,579"	"A celebrated writer's irresistible, candid, and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure, spiritual devotion, and what she really wanted out of life.Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be.To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone.Eat, Pray, Loveis the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly.An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery,Eat, Pray, Loveis about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.Show more"	"368"	"January 30, 2007"	"Nonfiction; Memoir; Travel; Book Club; Biography; Romance; Chick Lit"	"Italy,India,Bali(Indonesia),Rome(Italy),Ubud, Bali(Indonesia),Indonesia,Southeast Asia,New York City, New York(United States)"	"Liz Gilbert,Felipe,Richard from Texas,Wayan"	"9780143038412"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19501.Eat_Pray_Love"

As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms.

"A Promised Land"	"The Presidential Memoirs"	"Barack Obama"	"4.32"	"271,078"	"21,465"	"A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the making, from the president who inspired us to believe in the power of democracy.In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidency—a time of dramatic transformation and turmoil.Obama takes readers on a compelling journey from his earliest political aspirations to the pivotal Iowa caucus victory that demonstrated the power of grassroots activism to the watershed night of November 4, 2008, when he was elected 44th president of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the nation’s highest office.Reflecting on the presidency, he offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune’s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective—the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change,” and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama’s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.Show more"	"768"	"November 17, 2020"	"Nonfiction; Biography; Memoir; Politics; Audiobook; History; Autobiography"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781524763183"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55361205-a-promised-land"

"John Adams"	"None"	"David McCullough"	"4.08"	"376,194"	"7,705"	"The enthralling, often surprising story of John Adams, one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot -- "the colossus of independence," as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as "out of his senses"; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history.Like his masterly, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman, David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era.As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris "interest" Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President.Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country.At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826.Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget.It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James's, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House.This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.Show more"	"751"	"May 22, 2001"	"History; Biography; Nonfiction; American History; Presidents; Politics; Historical"	"Boston, Massachusetts(United States),Philadelphia, Pennsylvania(United States)"	"John Adams,Benjamin Franklin,John Dickinson,Abigail Adams,George Washington,Thomas Jefferson"	"9780743223133"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2203.John_Adams"
"Alexander Hamilton"	"None"	"Ron Chernow"	"4.22"	"198,318"	"10,853"	"An alternate cover edition can be foundhere.Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father who galvanized, inspired, scandalized, and shaped the newborn nation.In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis,Alexander Hamiltonis “a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.”Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. “To repudiate his legacy,” Chernow writes, “is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots,Alexander Hamiltonwill remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.Show more"	"818"	"March 29, 2005"	"History; Biography; Nonfiction; American History; Politics; Audiobook; Historical"	"The United States of America"	"Alexander Hamilton,Aaron Burr,George Washington,James Madison,Thomas Jefferson"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130.Alexander_Hamilton"

Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Show more"	"324"	"September 30, 2004"	"Science Fiction; Fiction; Young Adult; Fantasy; Classics; Science Fiction Fantasy; Dystopia"	"Outer Space"	"Dink,Bernard,Valentine Wiggin,Peter Wiggin,Mazer Rackham,Alai,Hyrum Graff,Andrew Wiggin,Petra Arkanian,"Bean",Major Anderson,Bonzo,Major Imbu"	"9780812550702"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game"

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty,A Game of Thronestells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.Show more"	"835"	"August 1, 2005"	"Fantasy; Fiction; Epic Fantasy; High Fantasy; Adult; Audiobook; Science Fiction Fantasy"	"The Lands of Ice and Fire,Westeros"	"Brandon Stark,Catelyn Stark,Tyrion Lannister,Daenerys Targaryen,Eddard Stark,Theon Greyjoy,Robb Stark,Arya Stark,Jaime Lannister,Joffrey Baratheon,Robert Baratheon,Tywin Lannister,Lysa Arryn,Petyr Baelish,Sansa Stark,Viserys Targaryen,Varys,Hodor,Beric Dondarrion,Thoros of Myr,Sandor Clegane,Samwell Tarly,Pyp,Tommen Baratheon,Stannis Baratheon,Grenn,Mace Tyrell,Septa Mordane,Jon Snow,Cersei Lannister,Jorah MormontShow more"	"9780553588484"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones"

Peter Jackson's "fierce, imaginative movie takes high-flying risks and inspires with its power and scale," wrote Newsweek. "In every way this is moviemaking on a grand scale," wrote the San Francisco Chronicle, while Time proclaimed the "grandeur, moral heft and emotional depth" of the film, which received thirteen Academy Award(R) nominations. Including more than 300 photographs from all three films, most unique to this book, and exclusive interviews with all the cast and crew, Brian Sibley's fascinating book takes every fan inside the process of adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork for the screen. For the first time in history, three major movies were made at the same time, a triumphant and monumental undertaking that took the world by storm. Here can be found details about the hundreds of dedicated artists, craftspeople and cast and crew members who labored for years -- adding authenticity at every stage -- to bring one of the greatest stories ever told to an eager film audience. Sibley takes us inside the process of filmmaking to show us how the magic is made -- from the director, writers and actors to wardrobe, makeup, miniatures, music and digital special effects, it's all here."It was tiring, physically and mentally, but never dull. Three movies, one big story, and so much variety: one day shooting scenes of intimate heart-wrenching drama, the next, vast battle scenes involving hundreds of extras. Every day brought an opportunity to create something new on this enormous canvas that is The Lord of the Rings." -- Peter JacksonShow more"	"192"	"November 6, 2002"	"Nonfiction; Film; Art; Media Tie In; Reference; Science Fiction Fantasy; Classics"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780618260225"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7351.The_Lord_of_the_Rings"

By age 13 she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate—a life and a role that she has never challenged ... until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is.

Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.It is no secret that Alcott basedLittle Womenon her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with "woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing.Little Womenbrought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the "girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.Show more"	"449"	"April 6, 2004"	"Classics; Fiction; Historical Fiction; Young Adult; Romance; Historical; Literature"	"Concord, Massachusetts(United States),Massachusetts(United States, 1862),London, England,New England(United States)"	"Marmee March,Margaret "Meg" March,Amy March,Theodore "Laurie" Laurence,James Laurence,Professor Bhaer,Mr. March,Hannah Mullet,Aunt March,John Brooke,Josephine "Jo" March,Beth March"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1934.Little_Women"
"Persuasion"	"None"	"Jane Austen; Deidre Shauna Lynch; James Kinsley"	"4.15"	"768,093"	"40,345"	"Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed novel. She began it soon after she had finished Emma, completing it in August 1816. She died, aged 41, in 1817; Persuasion was published in December that year (but dated 1818). Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805. Besides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, such as the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's brothers ultimately rose to the rank of admiral. As in Northanger Abbey, the superficial social life of Bath-well known to Austen, who spent several relatively unhappy and unproductive years there-is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of the book. In many respects Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.Show more"	"249"	"March 18, 2004"	"Classics; Fiction; Romance; Historical Fiction; Audiobook; Historical; Literature"	"Lyme Regis, England,Bath, Somerset, England(, 1816),Lyme Regis, England(, 1816),Somerset, England(United Kingdom),England,United Kingdom"	"Lady Russell,Charles Musgrove,Admiral Croft,Elizabeth Elliot,Captain Frederick Wentworth,Mary Musgrove,Sophia Croft,Sir Walter Elliot,Louisa Musgrove,Captain James Benwick,William Elliot,Mrs. Smith,Anne Elliot,Henrietta Musgrove,Captain Harville,Penelope Clay"	"9780192802637"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion"

Rølvaag; Lincoln Colcord"	"4.03"	"7,057"	"789"	"Giants in the Earth(Norwegian:Verdens Grøde) is a novel by Norwegian-American author Ole Edvart Rølvaag. First published in Norway as two books in 1924 and 1925, the author collaborated with Minnesotan Lincoln Colcord on the English translation.The novel follows a Norwegian family's struggles as they try to make a new life as pioneers in the Dakota territory. Rølvaag is interested in psychology and the human cost of empire building, at a time when other writers focused on the glamor and romance of the West. The book reflects his personal experiences as a settler as well as the immigrant homesteader experience of his wife’s family. Both the grim realities of pioneering and the gloomy fatalism of the Norse mind are captured in depictions of snow storms, locusts, poverty, hunger, loneliness, homesickness, the difficulty of fitting into a new culture, and the estrangement of immigrant children who grow up in a new land. It is a novel at once palpably European and distinctly American.Giants in the Earthwas turned into an opera by Douglas Moore and Arnold Sundgaard; it won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1951.Show more"	"531"	"August 4, 1999"	"Fiction; Historical Fiction; Classics; Book Club; Literature; Historical; Novels"	"Dakota Territory(United States)"	"Per Hansa"	"9780060931933"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57586.Giants_in_the_Earth"
"Pinocchio: With Reflections On A Father's Love"	"None"	"Franco Nembrini; Carlo Collodi"	"4.04"	"409"	"58"	"Carlo Collodi’s The Adventures of Pinocchio: The Story of a Puppet was first published in 1840 in serial form in the children’s magazine, Giornale per i Bambini. The original story ended at Chapter XV with Pinocchio hanging from a tree, dead at the hands of assassins. The young readers of Italy would have none of it though, for Pinocchio had become their hero. They flooded the magazine with letters begging for more, and so the editor wrote to Collodi demanding that he “resurrect” the puppet. In its final form, the novel sheds its status as a simple morality tale and transfigures Pinocchio’s singular trajectory into the story of every human being—the tremendous and inescapable “adventure” we are all asked to take together. The destination is at once simple and profound: for our end is to become really real.This timeless tale is so familiar that it is easy to miss the rich significance of Pinocchio’s story—his creation at the hands of the father Geppetto, who, as yet ignorant of the latent spark of life, names this wooden puppet Pino (pine, in Italian) -occhio (eye, in Italian), “a piece of wood with eyes.” Geppetto’s sacrificial love is undying despite Pinocchio’s pride and the puppet’s delinquent disappearance and descent into an underworld of misbehavior and humiliation. In a great reversal, the prodigal Pinocchio undertakes his own sacrificial, and saving, acts of love for the man who made him, quickening his transformation into a real boy at last.This edition, brought to you through the collaboration of Well-Read Mom and Wiseblood Books, pairs the original story with a commentary by the Italian writer, teacher, and Dante expert Franco Nembrini. By looking broadly and deeply at Collodi’s life, both his personal obsessions and disappointments, and by bringing his poetic vision into tension with the historical and cultural circumstances that existed when he was alive, Nembrini locates the uncompromising truth rooted at the core of this adventure: we were made by and for God, the Father who loves us and seeks us, who forgives us, and waits patiently for our return to him.Show more"	"364"	"January 1, 2024"	"Classics; Book Club; Fiction; Catholic; Christian; Childrens; Fantasy"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781963319804"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221864028-pinocchio"
"Ruth"	"None"	"Elizabeth Gaskell; Angus Easson"	"3.87"	"9,722"	"938"	"Elizabeth Gaskell'sRuth(1853) was the first mainstream novel to make a fallen woman its eponymous heroine. It is a remarkable story of love, of the sanctuary and tyranny of the family, and of the consequences of lies and deception, one that lays bare Victorian hypocrisy and sexual double-standards. Shocking to contemporary readers, its radical utopian vision of a pure woman faithfully presented predates Hardy's Tess by nearly forty years. This fully revised and corrected new edition is based on the three-volume first edition of 1853, collated with the one-volume 1855 edition. Tim Dolin's fascinating new introduction challenges the view ofRuthas one of Gaskell's weaker novels and explores its radicalism and cultural influence, highlighting the remarkable story of love, family, and hypocrisy that it tells. In addition, the book includes an up-to-date bibliography, a chronology of Gaskell's life and work, and invaluable notes that shed much light on the book's historical, religious, and literary allusions and points of significance.About the Series:For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Leaving his safe and orderly world for the first time in his life, Graham travels to Oxford, Russia and beyond in search of his lost son who might have become involved with a high-brow, New Age group. The father's odyssey leads him to fascinating and sometimes frightening people, places and perils - including imprisonment and torture for being mistaken as a spy.Through the uncertainty and the anguish, the loss and the longing, Graham considers his past - youth, marriage, and fatherhood. Apart from childhood illness and the loss of his beloved wife, the bookseller's life had gone rather smoothly within the confines of his small hometown, or so he had once believed.Pulled ever deeper into conflicts between nations, as well as the eternal conflict between good and evil, Graham is stretched nearly to the breaking point by the inexplicable suffering he witnesses and experiences. Struggling to overcome fear and discouragement, he discovers unexpected sources of strength as he presses onward in the hope of recovering his son--and himself.Show more"	"1076"	"September 1, 2011"	"Fiction; Catholic; Book Club; Christian; Religion; Christian Fiction; Christianity"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780898708158"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12707152-the-father-s-tale"

How could this wealthy, handsome youth cast away all the advantages that were his by birth and choose instead a career of poverty and humility? How could he attract members of all strata of society to his mission? And how, when his order became established throughout Europe, could he renounce great personal power and humbly continue his life’s work?Here is Francis, from his twelfth-century boyhoodto his life as a missionary roaming the very boundaries of the known world. Here too are the men and women who followed him—Bernard de Quintavalle, the rich businessman; Peter Cathanii, the lawyer; Brother Giles, the farmer’s son; Lady Clare; and so many others—all drawn together by the personal magnetism and humble faith of their leader, all re-created by bestselling novelist Elizabeth Goudge against a rich medieval canvas."An absorbing story…Elizabeth Goudge makes skillful use of contemporary sources, St. Francis’s own writings and those of his followers, and the legends – employing them with the skill of a gifted storyteller.

Alan Paton’s impassioned novel about a black man’s country under white man’s law is a work of searing beauty.Cry, the beloved country, for the unborn child that is the inheritor of our fear. Let him not love the earth too deeply. Let him not laugh too gladly when the water runs through his fingers, nor stand too silent when the setting sun makes red the veld with fire. Let him not be too moved when the birds of his land are singing, nor give too much of his heart to a mountain or valley. For fear will rob him of all if he gives too much.The eminent literary critic Lewis Gannett wrote, “We have had many novels from statesmen and reformers, almost all bad; many novels from poets, almost all thin.

Its figures harden their hearts, engage in violence, or try to alleviate the suffering of others. Lear himself rages until his sanity cracks. What, then, keeps bringing us back to King Lear? For all the force of its language, King Lear is almost equally powerful when translated, suggesting that it is the story, in large part, that draws us to the play.The play tells us about families struggling between greed and cruelty, on the one hand, and support and consolation, on the other. Emotions are extreme, magnified to gigantic proportions. We also see old age portrayed in all its vulnerability, pride, and, perhaps, wisdom—one reason this most devastating of Shakespeare’s tragedies is also perhaps his most moving.The authoritative edition of King Lear from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:-Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play-Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play-Scene-by-scene plot summaries-A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases-An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language-An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play-Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books-An annotated guide to further readingEssay by Susan SnyderThe Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

Ella escribió de lo sucedido en una tarde tranquila, borrada en la historia de la Revolución ; escribió de los momentos literalmente originales de la historia y de personajes únicos como Pablo López, como Catarino Acosta, como José Díaz, como Pancho Villa, un hombre que nació en 1910 , ya que antes nunca existió. Nellie Campobello escribió la crónica de lo que casi nadie quería, ni ha querido escribir: del periodo entre 1916 y 1920 en el estado de Chihuahua, que los historiadores coinciden en llamar la etapa más cruel que vivió Chihuahua durante la revolución y uno de los periodos más oscuros de toda su historia. El hallazgo iluminador de Campobello fue hundir la historia -la macrohistoria- en las minucias, en los rincones, en la anonimia, en los sobreentendidos, en los recintos más diminutos de la voluntad de los hacedores de esa historia. No hay detalle aquí que no tenga un sentido totalizador, no hay instante que no sea la grieta finísima por donde entra la eternidad. Este volumen contiene tambien, una cronología de la vida de la autora, que recoge los últimos datos disponibles, y una bibliografía actualizada.Show more"	"174"	"March 31, 2009"	"Spanish Literature; Short Stories; Fiction; Historical Fiction; Historical; Womens; School"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9789684114555"	"Spanish; Castilian"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1176395.Cartucho"

In this tale revolving around not just parents and children but brothers and sisters, cousins and caretakers, Hosseini explores the many ways in which families nurture, wound, betray, honor, and sacrifice for one another; and how often we are surprised by the actions of those closest to us, at the times that matter most.

"In Search of the Kite Runner"	"None"	"Judi Slayden Hayes"	"4.66"	"11,110"	"27"	"In Khaled Hosseini's best-selling novel The Kite Runner (Riverhead Books, 2003), Hosseini shows us an Afghanistan rich in tradition and culture and an Afghanistan torn apart by war and political strife. We see Muslims who are not so different from Christians or Jews. In Search of the Kite Runner looks at the basic themes that make The Kite Runner such a fascinating and thought-provoking story and that make it personal for anyone who has ever wished for a chance to do something over. Written from a Christian perspective, In Search of the Kite Runner begins with the rudiments of Islamic faith and the Islam of Afghanistan. The author likens the struggles of The Kite Runner's characters and those of other literary figures to the struggles and stories of biblical patriarchs. She brings to light the complexities of interpersonal and intrafamily relationships and examines the impact that power, guilt, and the quest for forgiveness and redemption can have on our lives. Exploring both the individual and the collective basis for doing good, Hayes probes our perceptions about what it means to be religious and what it means to be human.

According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs.

A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back.

No one quite knows the reason."Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time.For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His"wonderful, awful"idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires.

It was a remarkable night and it brought back vivid memories of being part of what appears to have become a cult classic film about pirates and princesses, giants and jesters, cliffs of insanity, and of course rodents of unusual size.It truly was as fun to make the movie as it is to watch it, from getting to work on William Goldman's brilliant screenplay to being directed by the inimitable Rob Reiner. It is not an exaggeration to say that most days on set were exhilarating, from wrestling André the Giant, to the impossibility of playing mostly dead with Billy Crystal cracking jokes above me, to choreographing the Greatest Sword Fight in Modern Times with Mandy Patinkin, to being part of the Kiss That Left All the Others Behind with Robin Wright.In this book I've gathered many more behind-the-scenes stories and hopefully answers to many of the questions we've all received over the years from fans. Additionally, Robin, Billy, Rob, and Mandy, as well as Christopher Guest, Wallace Shawn, Fred Savage, Chris Sarandon, Carol Kane, Norman Lear, and William Goldman graciously share their own memories and stories from making this treasured film.If you'd like to know a little more about the making ofThe Princess Brideas seen through the eyes of a young actor who got much more than he bargained for, along with the rest of this brilliant cast, then all I can say is...as you wish.Show more"	"259"	"October 14, 2014"	"Nonfiction; Memoir; Audiobook; Biography; Humor; Biography Memoir; Autobiography"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781476764023"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21412202-as-you-wish"

For twenty years, she has devoted every waking moment to the study of magic, fueled by a mad desire to achieve the impossible: to be the first woman ever admitted to the High Magistry. When she finally claws her way up the ranks to become a highmage, however, she finds that her challenges have just begun. Her new colleagues will stop at nothing to let her know she is unwelcome, beginning with giving her a janitor instead of a qualified lab assistant.What neither Sciona nor her peers realize is that her taciturn assistant was once more than a janitor; before he mopped floors for the mages, Thomil was a nomadic hunter from beyond Tiran’s magical barrier. Ten years have passed since he survived the perilous crossing that killed his family. But working for a highmage, he sees the opportunity to finally understand the forces that decimated his tribe, drove him from his homeland, and keep the Tiranish in power.Through their fractious relationship, mage and outsider uncover an ancient secret that could change the course of magic forever—if it doesn’t get them killed first.

When he awoke after his long sleep, he didn’t know much more than his name. His brain-fuzz is lingering, even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight. Somehow Percy manages to make it to the camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he had to continually kill monsters that, annoyingly, would not stay dead. But the camp doesn’t ring any bells with him.Hazel is supposed to be dead. When she lived before, she didn’t do a very good job of it. When the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her “gift” for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn’t say no. Now, because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk.Frank is a klutz. His grandmother claims he is descended from ancient heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn’t see it. He doesn’t even know who his father is. He keeps hoping Apollo will claim him, because the only thing he is good at is archery―although not good enough to help the Fifth Cohort win at war games. His big and bulky physique makes him feel like a clumsy ox, especially in front of Hazel, his closest friend at camp. He trusts her completely―enough, even, to share the secret he holds close to his heart.Featuring a faithful adaptation by Robert Venditti, and incredible artwork by Antoine Dodé and Orpheus Collar, Rick Riordan's blockbuster book comes to life in The Son of Neptune, The Graphic Novel .Show more"	"192"	"February 21, 2017"	"Graphic Novels; Fantasy; Mythology; Young Adult; Comics; Percy Jackson; Middle Grade"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781484723036"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28963878-the-son-of-neptune"

Stanowi realizację charakterystycznych dla epoki motywów: mówi o marności dóbr doczesnych, ich nieuchronnej przemijalności (vanitas) oraz o powszechnym zrównaniu ludzi różnych stanów, obu płci, zamożnych i biednych w obliczu śmierci, która wszystkich weźmie do swej „szkoły”, zaprosi do ostatniego tańca (Danse macabre).Jednocześnie utwór ma wymowę satyryczną. Wykorzystując gatunek tradycyjny dla rozważań filozoficznych (dialog), szydzi z niemocy ludzkiego rozumu, w duchu plebejskim naśmiewa się z uczonego magistra, który śmierci boi się jak każdy głupiec i drży przed nią niczym żak przed najsroższym nauczycielem. Satyra społeczna, bardzo wyraźnie zarysowana, dotyczy różnych stanów, szczególnie jednak godzi swym ostrzem w sędziów (grożąc demaskacją ich niesprawiedliwych czynów i pomstą za nie na Sądzie Ostatecznym) oraz duchowieństwo (potępia zarówno opasłych plebanów, jak rozkiełznanych mnichów, łamiących swe śluby).Utwór, datowany na lata 1463–1465, powstał w oparciu o pisany prozą wzór łaciński pt. Dialogus magistri Polycarpi cum morte. Staropolszczyzna tekstu zawiera dialektyzmy mazowieckie. Rękopis, znajdujący się w Bibliotece Seminaryjnej w Płocku, zaginął w czasie II wojny światowej. Szczęśliwie w 1904 r. opublikowany został odpis sporządzony przez Jana Rozwadowskiego, językoznawcy, profesora UJ, będący podstawą dalszych wydań.Źródło opisu: https://wolnelektury.pl/katalog/lektu...Show more"	"20"	"January 1, 2008"	"School; Classics; Poetry; Polish Literature; Fiction; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Polish"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17876081-rozmowa-mistrza-polikarpa-ze-mierci"

In October 1939 Captain Martin Bora discovers the abbess, Mother Kazimierza, shot dead in her convent garden. Her alleged power to see the future has brought her a devoted following; her work and motto, "Lumen Christi Adiuva Nos" ("Light of Christ, help us"), appear also to have brought some enemies. Father Malecki has come to Cracow, at the pope's bidding, to investigate Mother Kazimierza's powers. The Vatican orders him to stay and assist Bora in the inquiry into her killing. Stunned by the violence of the occupation and the ideology of his colleagues, Bora's sense of Prussian duty is tested to the breaking point. The interference of seductive actress Ewa Kowalska does not help matters. Ben Pastor , born in Italy, has lived for thirty years in the United States, working as a university professor in Vermont. She is the author of other novels, including The Water Thief and The Fire Walker (St. Martin's Press).Show more"	"288"	"April 19, 2011"	"Mystery; Fiction; Historical Fiction; Crime; Detective; Thriller; Mystery Thriller"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781904738664"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9660372-lumen"

In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953,The Crucibleis a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's "witch-hunts" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, "Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence."Show more"	"143"	"March 25, 2003"	"Classics; Plays; Fiction; Historical Fiction; School; Drama; Read For School"	"Salem, Massachusetts(United States),Massachusetts(United States)"	"Rev.

"Othello"	"None"	"William Shakespeare; Barbara A. Mowat; Paul Werstine"	"3.89"	"433,552"	"13,048"	"In Othello, Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona), with elopement, and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race, of age, of cultural background—that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.Show more"	"319"	"January 1, 2003"	"Classics; Plays; Shakespeare; Fiction; Drama; School; Theatre"	"Venice(Italy),Cyprus,Italy"	"Iago,Bianca,Othello,Miguel Cássio,Desdêmona,Emilia,Rodrigo"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12996.Othello"

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.”An instant bestseller,Slaughterhouse-Fivemade Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it.Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.Show more"	"275"	"January 12, 1999"	"Classics; Fiction; Science Fiction; Historical Fiction; War; Literature; Novels"	"Dresden(Germany, 1945),Tralfamadore,Ilium(United States),Germany,The United States of America"	"Billy Pilgrim,Kilgore Trout,Eliot Rosewater,Roland Weary,Paul Lazzaro,Edgar Derby,Robert Pilgrim,Valencia Merble,Barbara Pilgrim,Howard W.

Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there.

And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a “proper” family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude.John Williams’s luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet perfection.

Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence.

Set in an ambiance of glittering dreams and drab realities, it tells of the two fighters' struggles to escape the confinements of their existence, and of the men and women in their world.Fat Cityis a novel about the sporting life like no other ever written: without melodrama or false heroics, written with a truthfulness that is at once painful and beautiful.Denis Johnson:"Between the ages of 19 and 25 I studied Leonard Gardner’s book so closely that I began to fear I’d never be able to write anything but imitations of it, so I swore it off(...)When I was about 34 (the same age Gardner was when he published his), my first novel came out. About a year later I borrowedFat Cityfrom the library and read it. I could see immediately that ten years’ exile hadn’t saved me from the influence of its perfection — I’d taught myself to write in Gardner’s style, though not as well. And now, many years later, it’s still true: Leonard Gardner has something to say in every word I write."Joan Didion:"Leonard Gardner'sFat Cityaffected me more than any new fiction I have read in a long while, and I do not think it affected me only because I come from Fat City, or somewhere near it. He has got it exactly right--the hanging around gas stations, the field dust, the relentless oppressiveness of the weather, the bleak liaisons sealed on the levees and Greyhound buses--but he has done more than just get it down, he has made it a metaphor for the joyless in heart."David Wagoner:"The people he writes about are alive and three-dimensional, and have that meaty, sweaty immediacy I admire in novels and find so seldom. It's an odd, interesting world he explores here--as tense and vivid as the prose."Ivan Gold:"Gardner writes with power, with an insider's knowledge, and with a vividness and love for his characters which redeem them even when they're lost and beaten."Harry Mark Petrakis:"A man of real talent. He makes the savage world he writes of come alive to the point where the reader can smell the sweat, and feel the anguish of unremitting failure."Ross Macdonald: "In his pity and art Gardner moves beyond race, beyond guilt and punishment, as Twain and Melville did, into a tragic forgiveness. I have seldom read a novel as beautiful and individual as this one."Originally published in 1969, Fat City is an American classic whose stature has increased over the years.

Rowling, a successful writer of previous four books about a young wizard that enchanted the hearts of both the young and the grown-ups. Maybe the most important thing about this sequel is that it is the longest book of all seven, with its thirty-eight chapters and more than seven hundred pages (total number of pages varies according to the country; Swedish has, for example a thousand pages while UK version has seven hundred sixty six).Similar to the last four books, this one also revolves around young wizard named Harry Potter, his life in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his coming of age, relationship with his friends Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, but difference is that this book revolves more around Harry’s relationship with his godfather Sirius Black, introduced in the third book- Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.Also, the fifth book is somewhat more ‘mature’ and more ‘sinister’, because here readers learn that lord Voldemort (evil sorcerer and the nemesis of Harry) has indeed returned, along with his followers called ‘’Death Eaters’’ and that he has taken physical form and that the events that will happen because of their actions will be the core of the story.Click the Buy Now With One Click Button, and learn everything about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix .Harry potter and the order of phoenix, harry potter book 5, harry potter series kindle edition book 1-7, harry potter kindle free series, harry potter and the order of phoenix freeShow more"	"28"	"July 4, 2015"	"Fantasy; Harry Potter"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25857197-harry-potter-and-the-order-of-phoenix"

"Catch-22"	"Catch-22"	"Joseph Heller"	"3.99"	"882,139"	"27,060"	"Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest—and most celebrated—books of all time. In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more. Here, at last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature.Show more"	"453"	"September 4, 2004"	"Classics; Fiction; Historical Fiction; War; Humor; Literature; Novels"	"Italy"	"Yossarian,Chaplain Tappman,Milo Minderbinder,Nately,Colonel Cathcart,Doc Daneeka,General Dreedle,Major Major Major Major,Orr,Chief White Halfoat"	"9780684833392"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168668.Catch_22"

"The Pillars of the Earth"	"Kingsbridge"	"Ken Follett"	"4.35"	"822,674"	"41,441"	"Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makesThe Pillars of the Earthextraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape.Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the TV tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to thisAlternate Cover EditionShow more"	"976"	"October 2, 2007"	"Historical Fiction; Fiction; Historical; Fantasy; Classics; Audiobook; Medieval"	"England"	"Thomas Becket,Henry II of England,Tom Builder,Prior Philip,Aliena,Jack Jackson,Stephen of England,Empress Matilda,William Hamleigh,Ellen,Richard of Kingsbridge,Alfred Builder,Waleran Bigod,Lord Percy Hamleigh,Lady Regan Hamleigh,Remigius"	"9780451222138"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth"

In this perilous wartime setting, Rome is a tinderbox of four conflicting parties: the Allies—represented by Major John Bridger of the American-Canadian First Special Service Force—trying to capture Rome as the first Axis prize of war but encountering stiff opposition; the Germans—represented by Waffen-SS Colonel Wilhelm Hollmann, the German father of John Bridger—trying to throw the Allies back into the sea while holding Rome hostage and using it as a staging ground and supply line to the front; Pope Pius XII, deeply involved in the plot to remove Hitler from power while struggling to maintain Vatican impartiality, mediate between the West and Nazi Germany, save Rome from destruction, and protect the city’s Jews and others from extermination; and finally, the Partisans represented by Teresa Kruger, daughter of Hollmann and half-sister of John Bridger, who during the German Occupation is transformed from a passive member of Rome’s aristocracy to an active Resistance fighter.Based on actual historical events and newly released OSS/CIA and KGB documents, Altar of Resistance recounts in detail the long, hard road that led to the Allied liberation of Rome. War is about simple survival, and Bridger and Teresa must battle their father and the Nazi occupiers in the name of freedom; while the Allies’ secret agent—the Supreme Pontiff and leader of the Vatican’s Church of Spies, Roman-born Pope Pius XII—orchestrates events behind the scenes in an effort to thwart German oppression, ensure the overthrow of the Führer, and usher in a viable post-Hitler government.Show more"	"525"	"January 24, 2017"	"Historical Fiction; Historical; Novels; Fiction; Book Club; Drama; War"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	""	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33932485-altar-of-resistance"
"The Rising Tide"	"World War II: 1939-1945"	"Jeff Shaara"	"4.17"	"9,950"	"565"	"A modern master of the historical novel, Jeff Shaara has painted brilliant depictions of the Civil War, the Revolutionary War, and World War I. Now he embarks upon his most ambitious epic, a trilogy about the military conflict that defined the twentieth century.The Rising Tidebegins a staggering work of fiction bound to be a new generation's most poignant chronicle of World War II. With you-are-there immediacy, painstaking historical detail, and all-inclusive points of view, Shaara portrays the momentous and increasingly dramatic events that pulled America into the vortex of this monumental conflict.As Hitler conquers Poland, Norway, France, and most of Western Europe, England struggles to hold the line. When Germany's ally Japan launches a stunning attack on Pearl Harbor, America is drawn into the war, fighting to hold back the Japanese conquest of the Pacific, while standing side-by-side with their British ally, the last hope for turning the tide of the war.Through unforgettable battle scenes in the unforgiving deserts of North Africa and the rugged countryside of Sicily, Shaara tells this story through the voices of this conflict's most heroic figures, some familiar, some unknown. As British and American forces strike into the "soft underbelly" of Hitler's Fortress Europa, the new weapons of war come clearly into focus. In North Africa, tank battles unfold in a tapestry of dust and fire unlike any the world has ever seen. In Sicily, the Allies attack their enemy with a barely tested weapon: the paratrooper. As battles rage along the coasts of the Mediterranean, the momentum of the war begins to shift, setting the stage for the massive invasion of France, at a seaside resort called Normandy.More than an unprecedented and intimate portrait of those who waged this astonishing global war,The Rising Tideis a vivid gallery of characters both immortal and unknown: the as-yet obscure administrator Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose tireless efficiency helped win the war; his subordinates, clashing in both style and personality, from George Patton and Mark Clark to Omar Bradley and Bernard Montgomery. In the desolate hills and deserts, the Allies confront Erwin Rommel, the battlefield genius known as "the Desert Fox," a wounded beast who hands the Americans their first humiliating defeat in the European theater of the war. From tank driver to paratrooper to the men who gave the commands, Shaara's stirring portrayals bring the heroic and the tragic to life in brilliant detail.Show more"	"576"	"November 7, 2006"	"Historical Fiction; Fiction; World War II; War; Military Fiction; Historical; Military History"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780345461414"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29917.The_Rising_Tide"

An estate haunted by a beckoning evil. Half-seen figures who glare from dark towers and dusty windows- silent, foul phantoms who, day by day, night by night, come closer, ever closer. With growing horror, the helpless governess realizes the fiendish creatures want the children, seeking to corrupt their bodies, possess their minds, own their souls. But worse-much worse- the governess discovers that Miles and Flora have no terror of the lurking evil. For they want the walking dead as badly as the dead want them.Excerpt:I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong.

"Paradise Lost"	"None"	"John Milton"	"3.85"	"180,795"	"7,098"	"John Milton'sParadise Lostis one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition.

The Knight, the Miller, the Friar, the Squire, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people, with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page ofThe Canterbury Tales.If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.Show more"	"504"	"February 4, 2003"	"Classics; Fiction; Poetry; Literature; School; Medieval; Short Stories"	"England"	"The Wife of Bath"	"9780140424386"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2696.The_Canterbury_Tales"
"Beowulf"	"None"	"Unknown; Seamus Heaney"	"3.50"	"343,683"	"13,260"	"Composed toward the end of the first millennium, Beowulf is the elegiac narrative of the adventures of Beowulf, a Scandinavian hero who saves the Danes from the seemingly invincible monster Grendel and, later, from Grendel's mother. He then returns to his own country and dies in old age in a vivid fight against a dragon. The poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live on in the exhausted aftermath. In the contours of this story, at once remote and uncannily familiar at the beginning of the twenty-first century, Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney finds a resonance that summons power to the poetry from deep beneath its surface. Drawn to what he has called the "four-squareness of the utterance" in Beowulf and its immense emotional credibility, Heaney gives these epic qualities new and convincing reality for the contemporary reader.Show more"	"259"	"February 17, 2001"	"Classics; Poetry; Fiction; Fantasy; Mythology; School; Literature"	"Denmark,Geatland(Sweden),Sweden"	"Beowulf,Grendel,Onela,Unferth,Breca,Wiglaf,Wealhtheow,Hrothgar"	"9780393320978"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52357.Beowulf"

But all is upended when her brother Louis brings his graceless new girlfriend Eva, leaving her at Isabel’s doorstep as a guest, to stay for the season.Eva is Isabel’s antithesis: she sleeps late, walks loudly through the house, and touches things she shouldn’t.

In the sweltering peak of summer, Isabel’s paranoia gives way to infatuation—leading to a discovery that unravels all Isabel has ever known.

Besides knowing nothing about running such an agency, she was also guardian of her fifteen-year old brother. Vic brought his streetwise knowledge to support Maeve.In Book 2 Maeve, a quick learner, and Vic, having worked the “cases nobody wanted” managed to survive but found themselves in a much darker place. They had to deal with mobsters and as FBI informants this time around. Maeve had to toughen up and learn hard lessons about the underbelly of city life and the criminals who ran it.In Book 3 Maeve’s resolve is strained to the breaking point by demands from all sides. Though Vic supports her and does his best to protect her, she makes a difficult and dangerous decision to go against his advice. On one side, former first love, powerful Irish crime boss Lory, threatens her and those she cares about. On the other side, the FBI demands her help to stop him.

Telegrams and knocks at the door are dreaded by all as family, neighbors, and friends deal with tragic losses for themselves and others.From bombings instigated by Nazi collaborators and sympathizers, to boxing, to murder in the setting of a brand new stage play, Maeve is thwarted. Every day it’s only bad news with no progress. When a new theatre is built in Brooklyn for the play, Maeve finds herself involved in another situation she knows nothing about. This becomes Maeve and Vic’s most challenging year. Her brother Jimmy is now a senior in high school.

They are offered here both in their original texts and in superb English translations by Louise Varèse. Mrs. Varèse first published her versions of Rimbaud’s Illuminations in 1946. Since then she has revised her work and has included two poems which in the interim have been reclassified as part of Illuminations. This edition also contains two other series of prose poems, which include two poems only recently discovered in France, together with an introduction in which Miss Varèse discusses the complicated ins and outs of Rimbaldien scholarship and the special qualities of Rimbaud’s writing. Rimbaud was indeed the most astonishing of French geniuses. Fired in childhood with an ambition to write, he gave up poetry before he was twenty-one. Yet he had already produced some of the finest examples of French verse. He is best known for A Season in Hell, but his other prose poems are no less remarkable. While he was working on them he spoke of his interest in hallucinations––"des vertiges, des silences, des nuits." These perceptions were caught by the poet in a beam of pellucid, and strangely active language which still lights up––now here, now there––unexplored aspects of experience and thought.Show more"	"182"	"January 1, 1957"	"Poetry; Classics; France; French Literature; Fiction; 19th Century; Literature"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780811201841"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/565149.Illuminations"

How could it lose? But instead Salamon got a front-row seat at the Hollywood disaster of the decade. She shadowed the film from its early stages through the last of the eviscerating reviews, and met everyone from the actors to the technicians to the studio executives. They'd all signed on for a blockbuster, but there was a sense of impending doom from the start--heart-of-gold characters replaced Wolfe's satiric creations; affable Tom Hanks was cast as the patrician heel; Melanie Griffith appeared mid-shoot with new, bigger breasts. With a keen eye and ear, Salamon shows us how the best of intentions turned into a legendary Hollywood debacle.The Devil's Candy joins John Gregory Dunne's The Studio, Steven Bach's Final Cut, and William Goldman's Adventures in the Screen Trade as a classic for anyone interested in the workings of Hollywood. With a new afterword profiling De Palma ten years after the movie's devastating flop (and this book's best-selling publication), Julie Salamon has created a riveting insider's portrait of an industry where art, talent, ego, and money combine and clash on a monumental scale.Show more"	"448"	"May 1, 2002"	"Nonfiction; Film; Media Tie In; History; Pop Culture; Audiobook; Business"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780306811234"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122337.The_Devil_s_Candy"

By age 13 she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate—a life and a role that she has never challenged ... until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is.

Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart or let others lead you?

Every April, when the wind blows in from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same.

But that is just part of the story. Every day, letters, frequently addressed simply, “Juliet, Verona,” arrive in the city. They come by the truckload, in almost every language imaginable, written by romantics seeking Juliet’s counsel. Most of the missives talk of love, of course —love found and love lost, love sought and love remembered. And, amazingly, not one letter goes unanswered.Letters to Juliet tells the story of these letters and the volunteers who have been writing responses for more than seven decades —volunteers who first acted privately, and who are now sanctioned by the city of Verona as part of the Juliet Club .

But soon Bazarov’s outspoken rejection of authority and social conventions touches off quarrels, misunderstandings, and romantic entanglements that will utterly transform the Kirsanov household and reflect the changes taking place across all of nineteenth-century Russia.Fathers and Sons enraged the old and the young, reactionaries, romantics, and radicals alike when it was first published.

This girl falls in love with a very aristocratic prince—a man without principles, but charming in his childish egotism—extremely attractive by his sincerity, and with a full capacity for quite unconsciously committing the worst crimes toward those with whom life brings him into contact. The psychology of both the girl and the young aristocrat is very good, but where Dostoyevsky appears at his best is in representing how the other young man, rejected by the girl, devotes the whole existence to being her humble servant and again his own will become instrumental in throwing her into the hands of the aristocrat.Show more"	"460"	"October 20, 2000"	"Classics; Fiction; Russian Literature; Russia; Novels; Literature; 19th Century"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780898751048"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/329803.The_Insulted_and_Humiliated"

He was never accepted by the Russian public as being completely Russian in his thinking and political ideology, and indeed he was not. Gogol's Ukrainian upbringing is most evident in his early works which draw heavily from Ukrainian culture and folk history. His later writing was more subversive, openly satirizing the corruption he saw rampant throughout Russia's empire. Gogol was homosexual. At age seventeen he wrote passionate letters to a friend who, being two years older, had graduated before Gogol, leaving him bereft. Gogol eventually exiled himself from Russia, living in Rome. It was here that he enjoyed at least one mutual love affair with a man, but his lover died within a year of their meeting. Two years later Gogol fell in love with the poet Nikolai Yazykov and penned love letters to him, but his efforts came to nothing. Gogol died in Moscow and was buried at Davilov Monastery. His last words were placed on his tombstone: "And I shall laugh my bitter laugh." When Soviet authorities decided to demolish the monastery in 1931 and transfer Gogol's remains, it was discovered his body had been buried lying face down, leading some to wonder if he had been buried alive.Show more"	"64"	"January 1, 1970"	"Classics; Fiction; Russia; Short Stories; Russian Literature; Literature; 19th Century"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780451500403"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11904357-diary-of-a-madman"

Yet there are moments of exquisite tenderness in these troubled lives. Georgette, the transvestite who falls in love with a callous hoodlum; Tralala, the conniving prostitute who plumbs the depths of sexual degradation; and Harry, the strike leader who hides his true desires behind a boorish masculinity, are unforgettable creations.Last Exit to Brooklynwas banned by British courts in 1967, a decision that was reversed the following year with the help of a number of writers and critics including Anthony Burgess and Frank Kermode.Hubert Selby, Jr. (1928-2004) was born in Brooklyn, New York. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school and went to sea with the merchant marines. While at sea he was diagnosed with lung disease. With no other way to make a living, he decided to try writing: 'I knew the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer.' In 1964 he completed his first book,Last Exit to Brooklyn, which has since become a cult classic. In 1966, it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK. His other books includeThe Room,The Demon,Requiem for a Dream,The Willow TreeandWaiting Period. In 2000,Requiem for a Dreamwas adapted into a film starring Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, and directed by Darren Aronofsky.'Last Exit to Brooklynwill explode like a rusty hellish bombshell over America, and still be eagerly read in 100 years'Allen Ginsberg'An urgent tickertape from hell'SpectatorShow more"	"290"	"January 1, 2000"	"Fiction; Classics; New York; Novels; American; Literature; Contemporary"	"Brooklyn, New York City, New York(United States)"	"Harry Black,Big Joe,Tralala"	"9780747549925"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50275.Last_Exit_to_Brooklyn"

John became fast friends with Henry, a boy with spindly legs and a big, goofy smile.

"Abundance"	"None"	"Ezra Klein; Derek   Thompson"	"3.97"	"33,222"	"4,401"	"From bestselling authors and journalistic titans Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson,Abundanceis a once-in-a-generation, paradigm-shifting call to rethink big, entrenched problems that seem mired in systemic from climate change to housing, education to healthcare.To trace the global history of the twenty-first century so far is to trace a history of growing unaffordability and shortage. After years of refusing to build sufficient housing, the entire country has a national housing crisis. After years of slashing immigration, we don’t have enough workers. After decades of off-shoring manufacturing, we have a shortage of chips for cars and computers. Despite decades of being warned about the consequences of climate change, we haven’t built anything close to the clean energy infrastructure we need. The crisis that’s clicking into focus now has been building for decades—because we haven’t been building enough.Abundanceexplains that our problems today are not the results of yesteryear’s villains. Rather, one generation’s solutions have become the next generation’s problems. Rules and regulations designed to solve the environmental problems of the 1970s often prevent urban density and green energy projects that would help solve the environmental problems of the 2020s. Laws meant to ensure that government considers the consequences of its actions in matters of education and healthcare have made it too difficult for government to act consequentially. In the last few decades, our capacity to see problems has sharpened while our ability to solve them has diminished.Progress requires the ability to see promise rather than just peril in the creation of new ideas and projects, and an instinct to design systems and institutions that make building possible. In a book exploring how can move from a liberalism that not only protects and preserves but also builds, Klein and Thompson trace the political, economic, and cultural barriers to progress and how we can adopt a mindset directed toward abundance, and not scarcity, to overcome them.Show more"	"304"	"March 18, 2025"	"Nonfiction; Politics; Audiobook; Economics; History; Sociology; Science"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781668023488"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176444106-abundance"

A timely and absorbing civics lessons from an all-star team of writers and storytellers.The government is a vast, complex system that Americans pay for, rebel against, rely upon, dismiss, and celebrate. It’s also our shared resource for addressing the biggest problems of society. And it’s made up of people, mostly unrecognized and uncelebrated, doing work that can be deeply consequential and beneficial to everyone.Michael Lewis invited his favorite writers to find someone doing an interesting job for the government and write about them. The stories they found are unexpected, riveting, and inspiring, including a former coal miner devoted to making mine roofs less likely to collapse, saving thousands of lives; an IRS agent straight out of a crime thriller; and the manager who made the National Cemetery Administration the best-run organization, public or private, in the entire country.

InLawless, she argues that the Supreme Court is no longer practicing law; it’s running on vibes. By “vibes,” Litman means legal-ish claims that repackage the politics of conservative grievance and dress them up in robes.

In this deeply reported book, Katherine Stewart takes us to conferences of conspiracy-mongers, back-room strategy gatherings, and services at extremist churches, and profiles the people who want to tear it all down. She introduces us to reactionary Catholic activists, atheist billionaires, pseudo-Platonist intellectuals, self-appointed apostles of Jesus, disciples of Ayn Rand, women-hating opponents of “the gynocracy,” pro-natalists preoccupied with the dearth of white babies, Covid truthers, militia members masquerading as "concerned moms," and battalions of spirit warriors who appear to be inventing a new religion even as they set about attacking democracy and its foundations.Along the way, she provides a compelling analysis of the authoritarian reaction in the United States. She demonstrates that the movement relies on three very different groups-the funders, the thinkers, and the foot-soldiers-each with different beliefs and often conflicting aims.

In the decades since, Claire has attempted to forget her traumatic past by moving to the city and climbing the ranks as an investigative journalist... until an unexpected call from her father forces her to come back home and face it all anew.With the entire summer now looming ahead—a summer spent with nothing to do in her childhood home, with her estranged mother—Claire decides on a whim to accept a seasonal job at Galloway Farm, a muscadine vineyard in coastal South Carolina less than an hour away from where she grew up. At first glance, Galloway is an idyllic escape for Claire. A scenic retreat full of slow-paced nostalgia, as well as a place where her sister seemed truly happy in that last summer before she vanished, it feels like the perfect plan to pass the time. However, as soon as Claire starts to settle in, she stumbles across an old diary written by one of the vineyard's owners, and what at first seems like a story of young rebellion and love turns into something much more sinister as it begins to describe details of various unsolved crimes. As the days stretch on, Claire finds herself becoming more and more secluded as she starts to obsess over the diary's contents… as well as the lingering feeling that her own sister's disappearance may be somehow tied to it all.Galloway was supposed to be a place to help her move forward, but instead, Claire quickly finds herself immersed in her own dark and dangerous past.Show more"	"325"	"August 26, 2025"	"Thriller; Mystery; Mystery Thriller; Audiobook; Fiction; Suspense; Adult"	"South Carolina(United States)"	"Unknown"	"9781250887979"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217387937-forget-me-not"

A Dazai novel is at once immediately intelligible in Western terms and quite unlike any Western book."

"Cárcel de Amor"	"None"	"Diego de San Pedro"	"3.40"	"567"	"65"	"Cárcel de Amor es una obra de Diego de San Pedro, perteneciente al género de la novela sentimental. La primera edición de la novela, dedicada a Diego Fernández de Córdoba, se imprimió en Sevilla en 1492 y tuvo un enorme éxito, haciéndose durante los siglos XV y XVI veinte reimpresiones en España. Fue traducida a las principales lenguas europeas, y se hicieron numerosas ediciones bilingües y trilingües, que indican un probable uso didáctico. Como modelo de prosa literaria fue elogiada por Baltasar Gracián en su Agudeza y arte de ingenio.El autor aparece como un personaje en la obra, siguiendo la tradición de la ficción autobiográfica; la obra comienza cuando éste, según el esquema de la visión alegórica, se extravía en Sierra Morena, y se encuentra con un joven encadenado; este joven es Leriano, hijo del duque Guersio, que es llevado a la prisión del Amor por un monstruo llamado Deseo. Siguiéndoles, el autor entra en un castillo en la montaña, donde Leriano le confiesa su pasión por Laureola, hija del rey Gaulo de Macedonia, y le ruega que actúe como intermediario. El autor va en busca de Laureola y, tras hablarle de Leriano y del dolor que padece, logra ablandar su corazón y consigue que la muchacha le escriba una carta. Con la ayuda de una serie de personajes alegóricos (la Esperanza, la Satisfacción, la Tranquilidad, la Alegría...) libera de su cautiverio a Leriano, que se dirige a Macedonia para ver a Laureola, quien le recibe con agrado.Pero otro personaje que también pretende a Laureola, el malvado Persio, hijo del señor de Gavia, difunde rumores que ponen en peligro el honor de la doncella, de modo que Leriano lo desafía, venciéndole en dos ocasiones. La victoria de Leriano sobre Persio no soluciona la situación, porque el rey Gaulo, padre de Laureola, ha dado crédito a los falsos testimonios y condena a muerte a su hija. Leriano y sus partidarios asaltan la prisión donde Laureola aguarda la ejecución y la liberan, enfrentándose a todo el ejército real en una cruel batalla. En la lucha, capturan a uno de los calumniadores, que admite su culpa, con lo que el rey perdona a su hija. Laureola, preocupada por defender su honor y no levantar más sospechas, rechaza definitivamente a Leriano. Este, tras defender acaloradamente ante sus amigos y partidarios la actitud de sumisión caballeresca a la dama (recurriendo al Tratado en defensa de las virtuosas mujeres, de Diego de Valera), echa en una copa las cartas de Laureola, que ha roto, se bebe su contenido y se deja morir de inanición, mientras su madre entona un desesperado planto.La novela está constituida por tres núcleos narrativos que se disponen simétricamente. Siguiendo los tratados retóricos medievales, que no reconocían la novela como una forma literaria, San Pedro utiliza la narración como una unidad de extensión limitada que se inserta en un discurso, y la emplea junto con una gran variedad de géneros menores, en capítulos sueltos de una extensión similar a la de las demás unidades, como por ejemplo las cartas. Las divisiones de la novela se definen precisamente por el cambio de una unidad retórica a otra, de modo que los distintos modos discursivos se hallan siempre intercalados, sin que aparezcan en ningún momento dos unidades narrativas consecutivas. El método recomendado por los tratados retóricos como inicio de un discurso era la alegoría, y así comienzan sus obras muchos autores medievales.Show more"	"94"	"February 19, 2015"	"Classics; Medieval; Spanish Literature; Fiction; Literature; 15th Century; Romance"	"Macedonia(Greece)"	"Leriano,Laureola"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26821129-c-rcel-de-amor"

"And Then There Were None"	"None"	"Agatha Christie"	"4.27"	"1,588,573"	"80,581"	"First, there were ten—a curious assortment of strangers summoned as weekend guests to a little private island off the coast of Devon. Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:"Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none."When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.Show more"	"264"	"May 3, 2004"	"Mystery; Classics; Fiction; Agatha Christie; Thriller; Crime; Mystery Thriller"	"Devon, England,England"	"Justice Lawrence John Wargrave,Vera Elizabeth Claythorne,Philip Lombard,General John Gordon Macarthur,Dr Edward George Armstrong,Anthony James Marston,William Henry Blore,Mr Thomas Rogers,Mrs Ethel Rogers,Emily Caroline Brent,Isaac Morris,Fred Narracott"	"9780312330873"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16299.And_Then_There_Were_None"

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.The Complete Sherlock Holmes comprises four novels and fifty-six short stories revolving around the world’s most popular and influential fictional detective—the eccentric, arrogant, and ingenious Sherlock Holmes. He and his trusted friend, Dr. Watson, step from Holmes’s comfortable quarters at 221b Baker Street into the swirling fog of Victorian London to combine detailed observation and vast knowledge with brilliant deduction. Inevitably, Holmes rescues the innocent, confounds the guilty, and solves the most perplexing puzzles known to literature.Volume II of The Complete Sherlock Holmes begins with The Return of Sherlock Holmes. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, tired of writing about Holmes, had killed him off at the end of “The Final Problem,” the last tale in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (found in Volume I of The Complete Sherlock Holmes). Public demand for new Holmes stories was so great, however, that Conan Doyle eventually resurrected him. The first story in The Return, “The Adventure of the Empty House,” features Conan Doyle’s infamously inventive explanation of how Holmes escaped what seemed like certain death.This volume also includes two other collections of Holmes stories, His Last Bow and The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes; Conan Doyle’s final full-length Holmes novel, The Valley of Fear; a pair of parodies, “The Field Bazaar” and “How Watson Learned the Trick”; and two essays about the “private life” of the beloved sleuth.Show more"	"709"	"September 20, 2004"	"Classics; Mystery; Fiction; Short Stories; Crime; Detective; Literature"	"United Kingdom"	"James Moriarty,John Watson,Sherlock Holmes"	"9781593082048"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3586.The_Complete_Sherlock_Holmes"

This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic."When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy—exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling—does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies.Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors—yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness.Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.Show more"	"452"	"October 3, 2005"	"Nonfiction; Memoir; Biography; Classics; Ireland; Autobiography; Biography Memoir"	"Limerick(Ireland),New York (State)(United States),Ireland"	"Frank McCourt"	"9780007205233"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/252577.Angela_s_Ashes"

"Educated"	"None"	"Tara Westover"	"4.47"	"1,827,350"	"130,413"	"Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her "head-for-the-hills bag". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educatedis an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties.

Finishing this book and then forgetting about it is simply not an option.”—Janet Maslin, The New York TimesONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The New York Times Book Review, People, NPR, The Washington Post, Slate, Harper’s Bazaar, Time Out New York, Publishers Weekly, BookPageAn Oprah Daily Best Nonfiction Book of the Past Two Decades • A Kirkus Reviews Best Nonfiction Book of the CenturyAt the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade’s worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated.When Breath Becomes Airchronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naïve medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality.What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir.Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. “I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,” he wrote. “Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: ‘I can’t go on. I’ll go on.’” When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.Finalist for the PEN Center USA Literary Award in Creative Nonfiction and the Books for a Better Life Award in Inspirational MemoirShow more"	"208"	"January 12, 2016"	"Nonfiction; Memoir; Biography; Medicine; Book Club; Audiobook; Medical"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780812988413"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air"
"Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End"	"None"	"Atul Gawande"	"4.49"	"215,378"	"23,953"	"Ai rồi cũng chết! là một tuyệt phẩm đánh động lòng người được viết nên bởi bác sĩ kiêm tác giả best-seller Atul Gawande. Cuốn sách không chỉ có khả năng lay chuyển ngành y học hiện đại, mà nó còn sẽ giúp làm biến đổi hoàn toàn cuộc sống của muôn người - bao gồm chính bạn!Ngành y học thế giới đã có nhiều bước phát triển vượt bậc trong những năm giảm thiểu tỉ lệ tử vong trẻ sơ sinh, nâng cao tỉ lệ sống sót sau chấn thương, chữa trị và kiểm soát được nhiều loại bệnh tật - kể cả nhiều căn bệnh từng được xem là không có thuốc chữa trong quá khứ. Nhưng dù có bành trướng hùng mạnh đến đâu, y học vẫn muôn đời bất lực trước quy luật sinh-lão-bệnh-tử bất biến của con ngườ Mỗi khi con người phải đối diện với Tuổi Già và Cái Chết, những công cụ y học vốn dĩ quyền năng bỗng chốc phản bội lại chính lý tưởng cứu nhân độ thế mà chúng đang phục vụ.Bằng những công trình nghiên cứu khoa học giá trị và những câu chuyện sống động từ các bệnh nhân và người thân của chính mình, bác sĩ Gawande bóc trần cho chúng ta thấy những hệ lụy và nỗi đau mà con người phải gánh chịu bởi nghịch lý trên. Viện dưỡng lão vốn dĩ được lập ra với mục đích ban đầu tốt đẹp là giúp cho người cao tuổi có một cuộc sống hạnh phúc và viên mãn bất chấp tuổi già, nhưng nhiều nhà dưỡng lão ngày nay bị biến tướng thành những tòa nhà khép kín không khác gì nhà tù, nơi mà người già không được phép ăn những món ăn họ thích và không được phép làm những gì mình muốn. Nhiều bác sĩ được đào tạo xuất sắc về mặt chuyên môn, nhưng lại không biết cách làm thế nào để nói cho bệnh nhân biết sự thật về bệnh tình của họ; thay vào đó, bác sĩ lại vin vào những hy vọng hão huyền về khả năng cứu sống người bệnh của y học và đề xuất cho bệnh nhân hàng loạt biện pháp chữa trị để nuôi những hy vọng hão đó. Rốt cuộc, hành động này chỉ khiến cho người bệnh và cả thân nhân của họ thêm hao mòn khổ sở chứ không hề mang lại ích lợi gì cho họ cả về mặt thể xác lẫn tinh thần.Trong những cuốn sách của mình, bác sĩ phẫu thuật Atul Gawande đã dùng ngòi bút mạnh mẽ không chút sợ hãi của mình tiết lộ cho chúng ta biết sự thật đằng sau ngành y cũng như những cuộc chiến mà các thầy thuốc như ông phải đối mặt và tranh đấu vượt qua. Lần này, với tác phẩm Ai rồi cũng chết!, ông phơi bày cho chúng ta thấy những giới hạn và nhược điểm của ngành y - trong cả chuyên môn của ông lẫn những chuyên ngành khác - khi cuộc sống con người bị đe dọa bởi sự lão hóa và cái chết. Qua đó, ông cũng đồng thời khám phá ra rằng mọi chuyện đều có cách giải quyết, rằng chúng ta hoàn toàn có thể làm khác đi, để mang lại cuộc sống tốt đẹp hơn cho mọi người cũng như cho chính bản thân chúng ta.Để khai phá ngọn nguồn mọi vấn đề cũng như giải pháp, bác sĩ Gawande đã theo chân một nữ y tá làm công việc chăm sóc bệnh nhân tại gia, phỏng vấn nhiều người trong giới bác sĩ lão khoa và sinh hoạt cùng họ, và tiếp xúc với những nhà quản lý viện dưỡng lão có tư tưởng cấp tiến và nhân văn. Ông tìm thấy những con người biết cách nói lên sự thật và chứng minh cho cả thế giới thấy, rằng mỗi người chúng ta đều có thể và có quyền mưu cầu cho mình một cuộc sống tốt đẹp và hạnh phúc bất chấp tuổi già sức yếu mà không phải hy sinh những giá trị sống mà chúng ta yêu quý hoặc tôn thờ.Với cách kể chuyện chân thực, sống động, mê hoặc và đánh động lòng người của tác giả, quyển sách Ai rồi cũng chết!khẳng định với chúng ta rằ Mỗi con người sinh ra không phải chỉ để ăn, ngủ hay tồn tại qua ngày, mà chính là để được sống một cuộc sống đúng nghĩa; rằng mục đích cuối cùng của y học không phải để kéo dài sự tồn tại vô nghĩa của con người, mà chính là để giúp chúng ta có một cuộc sống mãi mãi đong đầy hạnh phúc - cho đến tận phút lâm chung!Show more"	"282"	"October 7, 2014"	"Nonfiction; Medicine; Science; Health; Medical; Book Club; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780805095159"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20696006-being-mortal"
"The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer"	"None"	"Siddhartha Mukherjee"	"4.34"	"113,191"	"9,324"	"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be foundhereandhere.The Emperor of All Maladiesis a magnificent, profoundly humane “biography” of cancer - from its first documented appearances thousands of years ago through the epic battles in the twentieth century to cure, control, and conquer it to a radical new understanding of its essence.Physician, researcher, and award-winning science writer, Siddhartha Mukherjee examines cancer with a cellular biologist’s precision, a historian’s perspective, and a biographer’s passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with - and perished from - for more than five thousand years.The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out “war against cancer.”The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee’s own leukemia patient, Carla,The Emperor of All Maladiesis about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive—and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease.Riveting, urgent, and surprising,The Emperor of All Maladiesprovides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer.Show more"	"472"	"November 16, 2010"	"Nonfiction; Science; History; Medicine; Medical; Health; Biology"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7170627-the-emperor-of-all-maladies"

A slip of the hand and life ebbs away.The balance between life and death is so delicate, and the heart surgeon walks that rope between the two. In the operating room there is no time for doubt.

Like everyone she targets, Lucien is useful to her and used by her. Sadie operates by strategy and dissimulation, based on what her “contacts”—shadowy figures in business and government—instruct. First, these contacts want her to incite provocation. Then they want more.In this region of old farms and prehistoric caves, Sadie becomes entranced by a mysterious figure named Bruno Lacombe, a mentor to the young activists who believes that the path to emancipation is not revolt but a return to the ancient past. Just as Sadie is certain she’s the seductress and puppet master of those she surveils, Bruno is seducing her with his ingenious counter-histories, his artful laments, his own tragic story.Written in short, vaulting sections, Rachel Kushner’s rendition of “noir” is taut and dazzling.

On a battlefield near the River Aisne, John lies in the aftermath of a blast, unable to move or feel his legs. Struggling to focus his thoughts, he is lost to memory—a chance encounter in a pub by a railway, a hot bath with his lover on a winter night, his childhood on a faraway coast—as the snow falls.1920. John has returned from war to North Yorkshire, near another river—alive, but not whole. Reunited with Helena, an artist, he reopens his photography business and endeavours to keep on living. But the past erupts insistently into the present, as ghosts begin to surface in his ghosts whose messages he cannot understand .So begins a narrative that spans four generations, moments of connection and consequence igniting and re-igniting as the century unfolds. In luminous moments of desire, comprehension, longing, and transcendence, the sparks fly upward, working their transformations decades later. This resonance through time—not only of actions but also of feelings and perceptions—desire in its many forms—are at the heart of this novel’s profound investigation.Held is a deeply affecting and intensely beautiful novel, full of unforgettable characters and imagery, wisdom and compassion. It explores the deepest mysteries, and the ways in which desire in its many forms—and perhaps the deepest desire, to find meaning—manifests itself. Held moves through history to light upon Darwin, Sir Ernest Rutherford, North Sea ganseys, early photography, Ella Mary Leather, modern field hospitals…while lovers find each other and snow drifts down across the centuries.

Though separated in age by three decades, the pair are kindred spirits—torn between their commitment to religion and their desire to explore the world beyond their small Baptist community. It is two romantic relationships that will rend their friendship, and in the wake of this rupture, Thomas develops an obsession with a vanished nineteenth-century astronomer said to haunt a nearby manor, and Grace flees Aldleigh entirely for London.Over the course of twenty years, by coincidence and design, Thomas and Grace will find their lives brought back into orbit as the mystery of the vanished astronomer unfolds into a devastating tale of love and scientific pursuit.

"The Complete Stories and Poems"	"None"	"Edgar Allan Poe"	"4.40"	"294,373"	"3,598"	"Edgar Allan Poe was one of the most original writers in the history of American letters, a genius who was tragically misunderstood in his lifetime. He was a seminal figure in the development of science fiction and the detective story, and exerted a great influence on Dostoyevsky, Arthur Conan Doyle, Jules Verne, and Charles Baudelaire, who championed him long before Poe was appreciated in his own country. Baudelaire's enthusiasm brought Poe a wide audience in Europe, and his writing came to have enormous importance for modern French literature. This edition includes his most well-known works--"The Raven," "The Pit and the Pendulum," "Annabel Lee," "The Fall of the House of Usher," "The Murders in the Rue Morgue"--as well as less-familiar stories, poems, and essays.Show more"	"821"	"August 15, 1984"	"Classics; Poetry; Horror; Fiction; Short Stories; Gothic; Mystery"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780385074070"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23919.The_Complete_Stories_and_Poems"
"The Collected Poems"	"None"	"Sylvia Plath"	"4.25"	"50,519"	"1,011"	""By the time of her death, on 11 February, 1963, Sylvia Plath had written a large bulk of poetry. To my knowledge, she never scrapped any of her poetic efforts. With one or two exceptions, she brought every piece she worked on to some final form acceptable to her, rejecting at most the odd verse, or a false head or a false tail. Her attitude to her verse was artisan-like: if she couldn't get a table out of the material, she was quite happy to get a chair, or even a toy. The end product for her was not so much a successful poem, as something that had temporarily exhausted her ingenuity. So this book contains not merely what verse she saved, but-after 1956-all she wrote." -Ted Hughes, from the IntroductionShow more"	"384"	"March 6, 2018"	"Poetry; Classics; Fiction; Feminism; Literature; 20th Century; American"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2078076.The_Collected_Poems"

And in New Orleans, on Christmas Eve, this strangest of family sagas is brought to its startling climax.Show more"	"1216"	"November 4, 2004"	"Horror; Fantasy; Fiction; Paranormal; Witches; Supernatural; Gothic"	"New Orleans, Louisiana(United States),Louisiana(United States),Scotland Yard, London, England(United Kingdom)"	"Rowan Mayfair,Michael James Timothy Curry,Aaron Lightner,Lasher,Deirdre Mayfair,Stella Mayfair,Mary Beth Mayfair,Antha Mayfair,Carlotta Mayfair,Ellie Mayfair,Julien Mayfair,Marie Claudette Mayfair Landry,Angélique Mayfair,Katherine Mayfair,Remy Mayfair,Graham Franklin,Lionel Mayfair,Belle Mayfair,Darcy Monahan,Sean Lacy,Petyr van Abel,Deborah Mayfair de Montcleve,Suzanne Mayfair,Lestan Mayfair,Marguerite Mayfair,Tyrone Clifford McNamara,Augustin Mayfair,Jeannette Mayfair,Cortland Mayfair,Barclay Mayfair,Garland Mayfair,Corrington Mayfair,Daniel McIntyre,Nancy Mayfair,Millie Mayfair,Amanda Grady Mayfair,Sean McIntyre,Alice MayfairShow more"	"9780099471424"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11901.The_Witching_Hour"

Vampires are created--mortals succumbing to the sensation of "being emptied, of being devoured, of being nothing." Vampires are destroyed.  Dark rituals are performed--the rituals of ancient creatures prowling the modern world.  And, finally, we are brought to a moment in the twentieth century when, in an astonishing climax, the fate of the living dead--and perhaps of the living, all the living--will be decided.From the Hardcover edition.Show more"	"448"	"November 29, 1997"	"Horror; Fantasy; Vampires; Fiction; Paranormal; Supernatural; Urban Fantasy"	"Unknown"	"Lestat de Lioncourt,Gabrielle de Lioncourt,Maharet,Akasha,Enkil,Mael,Khayman,Jesse Miriam Reeves,Marius de Romanus,Daniel Molloy,Louis de Pointe du Lac,Armand"	"9780345419620"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43758.The_Queen_of_the_Damned"

"Books of Blood, Volumes 1-6"	"Books of Blood"	"Clive Barker"	"4.08"	"909"	"68"	"BRINGS TOGETHER ALL SIX BOOKS OF BLOOD"Everybody is a book of blood; wherever we're opened, we're red." For those who only know Clive Barker through his long multigenre novels, this complete edition of theBooks of Bloodis a welcome chance to acquire all six volumes and 30 remarkable horror short stories written by the British author Clive Barker. For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator's mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes:I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present.Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago.These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: "The Midnight Meat Train," a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; "The Yattering and Jack," about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; "In the Hills, the Cities," an unusual example of an original horror premise; "Dread," a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; "Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament," about a woman who kills men with her mind. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but all are distinguished by strikingly beautiful images of evil and destruction. No horror library is complete without them.--Fiona WebsterShow more"	"818"	"February 1, 2002"	"Horror; Short Stories; Fiction; Fantasy; Anthologies; Dark; Collections"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781588810403"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/103031.Books_of_Blood_Volumes_1_6"

The passion that furtively develops between them--along with Callie's failure to develop--leads Callie to suspect that she is not like other girls. In fact, she is not really a girl at all.The explanation for this shocking state of affairs takes us out of suburbia- back before the Detroit race riots of 1967, before the rise of the Motor City and Prohibition, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie's grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set in motion the metamorphosis that will turn Callie into a being both mythical and perfectly a hermaphrodite.Spanning eight decades--and one unusually awkward adolescence- Jeffrey Eugenides's long-awaited second novel is a grand, utterly original fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender, and the deep, untidy promptings of desire.Show more"	"529"	"September 16, 2002"	"Fiction; Historical Fiction; Book Club; Contemporary; LGBT; Classics; Literary Fiction"	"Bursa(Turkey),Izmir(Turkey),Detroit, Michigan(United States),Berlin(Germany),Michigan(United States),San Francisco, California(United States),Grosse Pointe, Michigan(United States)"	"Calliope Stephanides,Eleutherios Stephanides,Desdemona Stephanides,Sourmelina Zizmo,Miltiades Stephanides,Theodora Stephanides,Chapter Eleven,The Obscure Object,James Zizmo,Michael Antoniou"	"9780312422158"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2187.Middlesex"
"The Corrections"	"None"	"Jonathan Franzen"	"3.84"	"196,873"	"12,801"	""The Corrections" is a grandly entertaining novel for the new century - a comic, tragic masterpiece about a family breaking down in an age of easy fixes.After almost fifty years as a wife and mother, Enid Lambert is ready to have some fun. Unfortunately, her husband, Alfred, is losing his sanity to Parkinson's disease, and their children have long since flown the family nest to the catastrophes of their own lives. The oldest, Gary, a once-stable portfolio manager and family man, is trying to convince his wife and himself, despite clear signs to the contrary, that he is not clinically depressed. The middle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly secure academic job and is failing spectacularly at his new line of work. And Denise, the youngest, has escaped a disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man - or so her mother fears. Desperate for some pleasure to look forward to, Enid has set her heart on an elusive goal: bringing her family together for one last Christmas at home.Stretching from the Midwest at midcentury to the Wall Street and Eastern Europe of today, "The Corrections" brings an old-fashioned world of civic virtue and sexual inhibitions into violent collision with the era of home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and globalised greed. Richly realistic, darkly hilarious, deeply humane, it confirms Jonathan Franzen as one of our most brilliant interpreters of American society and the American soul.Show more"	"653"	"September 2, 2002"	"Fiction; Contemporary; Literary Fiction; Novels; Book Club; Literature; American"	"St. Jude, Illinois(United States),New York City, New York(United States),Philadelphia, Pennsylvania(United States)"	"Alfred Lambert,Enid Lambert,Gary Lambert,Chip Lambert,Denise Lambert,Robin Passafaro,Brian Callahan,Sylvia Wroth,Julia Vrais"	"9781841156736"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3805.The_Corrections"

"A Visit from the Goon Squad"	"Goon Squad"	"Jennifer Egan"	"3.70"	"247,777"	"25,123"	"Jennifer Egan’s spellbinding interlocking narratives circle the lives of Bennie Salazar, an aging former punk rocker and record executive, and Sasha, the passionate, troubled young woman he employs. Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each other’s pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years, in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Kenya.We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapist’s couch in New York City, confronting her long-standing compulsion to steal. Later, we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then as a runaway living in Naples, then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We plunge into the hidden yearnings and disappointments of her uncle, an art historian stuck in a dead marriage, who travels to Naples to extract Sasha from the city’s demimonde and experiences an epiphany of his own while staring at a sculpture of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Museo Nazionale. We meet Bennie Salazar at the melancholy nadir of his adult life—divorced, struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son, listening to a washed-up band in the basement of a suburban house—and then revisit him in 1979, at the height of his youth, shy and tender, reveling in San Francisco’s punk scene as he discovers his ardor for rock and roll and his gift for spotting talent. We learn what became of his high school gang—who thrived and who faltered—and we encounter Lou Kline, Bennie’s catastrophically careless mentor, along with the lovers and children left behind in the wake of Lou’s far-flung sexual conquests and meteoric rise and fall.A Visit from the Goon Squadis a book about the interplay of time and music, about survival, about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates. In a breathtaking array of styles and tones ranging from tragedy to satire to PowerPoint, Egan captures the undertow of self-destruction that we all must either master or succumb to; the basic human hunger for redemption; and the universal tendency to reach for both—and escape the merciless progress of time—in the transporting realms of art and music. Sly, startling, exhilarating work from one of our boldest writers.Show more"	"274"	"June 8, 2010"	"Fiction; Book Club; Contemporary; Music; Short Stories; Literary Fiction; Novels"	"San Francisco, California(United States),New York City, New York(United States),Crandale, New York(United States),Naples(Italy),Pompeii(Italy),Los Angeles, California(United States),Times Square, New York City, New York(United States)"	"Bennie Salazar,Lou Kline,Scotty Hausmann,Bill Duff,Jules Jones,Dolly Peale,Kitty Jackson,Ted Hollander,Sasha Blake,Andy Grady,Mark Avery,Rachel Costanza,Beth Grady,Alison Blake"	"9780307592835"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7331435-a-visit-from-the-goon-squad"
"Lincoln in the Bardo"	"None"	"George Saunders"	"3.75"	"173,478"	"26,634"	"In his long-awaited first novel, American master George Saunders delivers his most original, transcendent, and moving work yet. Unfolding in a graveyard over the course of a single night, narrated by a dazzling chorus of voices,Lincoln in the Bardois a literary experience unlike any other—for no one but Saunders could conceive it.February 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln's beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. "My poor boy, he was too good for this earth," the president says at the time. "God has called him home." Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returned to the crypt several times alone to hold his boy's body.From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a thrilling, supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory, where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state—called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo—a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie's soul.Lincoln in the Bardois an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction's ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices—living and dead, historical and invented—to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end?Show more"	"368"	"February 14, 2017"	"Fiction; Historical Fiction; Audiobook; Book Club; Fantasy; Literary Fiction; Historical"	"Washington, D.C.(United States, 1862)"	"Abraham Lincoln"	"9780812995343"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo"
"The Sellout"	"None"	"Paul Beatty"	"3.75"	"74,419"	"8,091"	"A biting satire about a young man's isolated upbringing and the race trial that sends him to the Supreme Court, Paul Beatty's The Sellout showcases a comic genius at the top of his game. It challenges the sacred tenets of the United States Constitution, urban life, the civil rights movement, the father-son relationship, and the holy grail of racial equality―the black Chinese restaurant.Born in the "agrarian ghetto" of Dickens―on the southern outskirts of Los Angeles―the narrator of The Sellout resigns himself to the fate of lower-middle-class Californians: "I'd die in the same bedroom I'd grown up in, looking up at the cracks in the stucco ceiling that've been there since '68 quake." Raised by a single father, a controversial sociologist, he spent his childhood as the subject in racially charged psychological studies. He is led to believe that his father's pioneering work will result in a memoir that will solve his family's financial woes. But when his father is killed in a police shoot-out, he realizes there never was a memoir. All that's left is the bill for a drive-thru funeral.Fueled by this deceit and the general disrepair of his hometown, the narrator sets out to right another wrong: Dickens has literally been removed from the map to save California from further embarrassment. Enlisting the help of the town's most famous resident―the last surviving Little Rascal, Hominy Jenkins―he initiates the most outrageous action conceivable: reinstating slavery and segregating the local high school, which lands him in the Supreme Court.Show more"	"289"	"January 1, 2015"	"Fiction; Book Club; Humor; Satire; Contemporary; Race; Literary Fiction"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780374260507"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237161-the-sellout"

Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe.

Readers of Sebastian Junger’sThe Perfect Storm, Erik Larsen’sDead Wake, and Nathaniel Philbrick’sIn the Heart of the Seawill love this deeply reported tale." —Hampton Sides,New York Timesbest-selling author ofThe Wide Wide SeaandIn the Kingdom of Ice“The Untold Story of the Edmund Fitzgerald’ has been told and retold by authors and bards. But never has it been told better than by Mr. Bacon in this colorful and compelling book.... Dead men tell no tales, but their loved ones do. Mr. Bacon tracked them down and listened.” —John J. Miller,Wall Street JournalOn the fiftieth anniversary of the Edmund Fitzgerald’s sinking, the bestselling author ofThe Great Halifax Explosiontells the definitive story of the “Mighty Fitz.”For three decades following World War II, the Great Lakes overtook Europe as the epicenter of global economic strength. The region was the beating heart of the world economy, possessing all the power and prestige Silicon Valley does today. And no ship represented the apex of the American Century better than the 729-foot-longEdmund Fitzgerald—the biggest, best, and most profitable ship on the Lakes.But on November 10, 1975, as the “storm of the century” threw 100 mile-per-hour winds and 50-foot waves on Lake Superior, the Mighty Fitz found itself at the worst possible place, at the worst possible time. When she sank, she took all 29 men onboard down with her, leaving the tragedy shrouded in mystery for a half century.InThe Gales of November, award-winning journalist John U. Bacon presents the definitive account of the disaster, drawing on more than 100 interviews with the families, friends, and former crewmates of those lost. Bacon explores the vital role Great Lakes shipping played in America’s economic boom, the uncommon lives the sailors led, the sinking’s most likely causes, and the heartbreaking aftermath for those left behind—"the wives, the sons, and the daughters,” as Gordon Lightfoot sang in his unforgettable ballad.Focused on those directly affected by the tragedy,The Gales of Novemberis both an emotional tribute to the lives lost and a propulsive, page-turning narrative history of America’s most-mourned maritime disaster.Show more"	"430"	"October 7, 2025"	"History; Nonfiction; Audiobook; American History; Historical; Adult; Music"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781324094654"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226573163-the-gales-of-november"

But behind the flashing ticker tapes and panicked traders, another drama unfolded—one of visionaries and fraudsters, titans and dreamers, euphoria and ruin.With unparalleled access to historical records and newly uncovered documents, New York Times bestselling author Andrew Ross Sorkin takes readers inside the chaos of the crash, behind the scenes of a raging battle between Wall Street and Washington and the larger-than-life characters whose ambition and naivete in an endless boom led to disaster. The dizzying highs and brutal lows of this era eerily mirror today’s world—where markets soar, political tensions mount, and the fight over financial influence plays out once again.This is not just a story about money. 1929 is a tale of power, psychology, and the seductive illusion that “this time is different.” It’s about disregarded alarm bells, financiers who fell from grace, and skeptics who saw the crash coming—only to be dismissed until it was too late.Hailed as a landmark book, Too Big to Fail reimagined how financial crises are told. Now, with 1929, Sorkin delivers an immersive, electrifying account of the most pivotal market collapse of all time—with lessons that remain as urgent as ever. More than just a history, 1929 is a crucial blueprint for understanding the cycles of speculation, the forces that drive financial upheaval, and the warning signs we ignore at our peril.*The Atlantic MonthlyShow more"	"577"	"October 14, 2025"	"History; Nonfiction; Economics; Finance; Business; American History; Politics"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780241479421"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211179569-1929"
"We the People: A History of the U.S. Constitution"	"None"	"Jill Lepore"	"4.34"	"549"	"107"	"The U.S. Constitution is among the oldest constitutions in the world--and one of the most difficult to amend. At what cost? In this landmark, lavishly illustrated book, Harvard professor of history and law Jill Lepore argues that the philosophy of amendment is foundational to American constitutionalism. Challenging both originalism and the Supreme Court's monopoly on constitutional interpretation, Lepore argues that the framers never intended for the Constitution to be kept, like a butterfly, under glass, but instead expected that future generations would be forever tinkering with it, improving the machinery of government. In an account as radical as Charles Beard'sAn Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States, Lepore offers a sweeping, lyrical, and democratic constitutional history, telling the stories of generations of Americans who have attempted everything from abolishing the Electoral College to guaranteeing environmental rights, hoping to mend America by amending its constitution.Show more"	"720"	"September 16, 2025"	"History; Nonfiction; Politics; American History; Law; Political Science; Historical"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781631496080"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223736225-we-the-people"

Readers will gain a fresh appreciation for how it was drafted to inspire unity, equality, and the enduring promise of America.

Fox was one of the biggest stars on television. His world was about to get even bigger, but only if he could survive the kind of double duty unheard of in Hollywood. Fox’s days were already dedicated to rehearsing and taping the hit sitcom Family Ties, but then the chance of a lifetime came his way. Soon, he committed his nights to a new time-travel adventure film being directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Spielberg―Back to the Future. Sitcom during the day, movie at night―day after day, for months.Fox’s nightly commute from a soundstage at Paramount to the back lot at Universal Studios, from one dream job to another, would become his own space-time continuum. It was in this time portal that Alex P. Keaton handed the baton to Marty McFly while Michael J. Fox tried to catch a few minutes of sleep. Alex’s bravado, Marty’s flair, and Fox’s comedic virtuosity all swirled together to create something truly special.In Future Boy, Fox tells the remarkable story of playing two landmark roles at the same time―a slice of entertainment history that’s never been told. Using new interviews with the cast and crew of both projects, the result is a vividly drawn and eye-opening story of creative achievement by a beloved icon.Show more"	"176"	"October 14, 2025"	"Nonfiction; Memoir; Biography; Autobiography; Biography Memoir; Media Tie In; Film"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781250866783"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219743625-future-boy"

I choose the former.”Charlie Sheen should not be alive to write this book.But in The Book of Sheen, the movie and TV star, who has defied the odds, finally presents his story, in his own words.Charlie Sheen was born the third of four children to actor Martin Sheen and his wife, Janet. He grew up on film sets—from his father’s all over the world, to his own in Malibu. There he made ambitious Super 8s, with a roster of friends who went on to become household names themselves, including his brother Emilio, Sean and Chris Penn, and the Lowe brothers.Sheen broke into movies in the 1980s, playing a hoodlum in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, a young soldier in Platoon, and an ethically compromised trader in Wall Street. But somewhere along the way, despite a successful transition to TV leading man in Spin City and Two and a Half Men, Sheen descended into a vortex of extracurricular activities.Now sober, Sheen delivers a clear-eyed narrative of his highs and lows with humor, candor, and a vivid, captivating writing style that is uniquely his.

Isolated and bored, Effi finds comfort and distraction in a brief liaison with Major Crampas, a married man with a dangerous reputation. But years later, when Effi has almost forgotten her affair, the secret returns to haunt her - with fatal consequences. In taut, ironic prose Fontane depicts a world where sexuality and the will to enjoy life are stifled by vain pretences of civilization, and the obligations of circumstance. Considered to be his greatest novel, this is a humane, unsentimental portrait of a young woman torn between her duties as a wife and mother and the instincts of her heart.Hugh Rorrison's clear, modern translation is accompanied by an introduction by Helen Chambers, which compares Effi with other literary heroines such as Emma Bovary and Anna Karenina.Theodor Fontane (1819-98) was a German novelist and potitical reporter. Along withEffi Briest, Fontane is remembered forFrau Jenny Treibel(1892), an ironic criticism of middle-class hypocrisy and small-mindedness.If you enjoyedEffi Briestyou may like Leo Tolstoy'sAnna Karenina, also available in Penguin Classics.'I have been haunted by it ... as I am by those novels that seem to do more than they say, to induce strong emotions that can't quite be accounted for'Hermione Lee,Sunday TimesShow more"	"272"	"November 18, 1976"	"Classics; Fiction; German Literature; Germany; School; 19th Century; Literature"	"Germany,Pomerania(Germany),Brandenburg(Germany),Berlin(Germany)"	"Effi Briest,Geert von Innstetten,Major Crampas,Roswitha Gellenhagen,Effi Briest, Geert von Innstetten, Major Crampas, Roswitha Gellenhagen"	"9780140441901"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/442296.Effi_Briest"

So entsteht ein Geflecht von Lebensberichten und -beichten, ein Sittenbild der ostdeutschen Nachkriegsgesellschaft, mit allen erdenklichen erotischen, ökonomischen und kriminellen Verwicklungen.Was leicht zur lehrbuchartigen Versuchsanordnung hätte geraten können, liest sich dank des ständigen Perspektivenwechsels und der erstklassigen Dialoge ausgesprochen unterhaltsam, quasi wieShort Cutsin Sachsen.

Although only 24 when he signed his first publishing contract for the book, Joyce already knew its worth: to alter it in any way would 'retard the course of civilisation in Ireland'.Joyce's aim was to tell the truth — to create a work of art that would reflect life in Ireland at the turn of the last century and by rejecting euphemism, reveal to the Irish the unromantic reality the recognition of which would lead to the spiritual liberation of the country.Each of the fifteen stories offers a glimpse of the lives of ordinary Dubliners — a death, an encounter, an opportunity not taken, a memory rekindled — and collectively they paint a portrait of a nation.Show more"	"352"	"January 4, 2001"	"Classics; Fiction; Short Stories; Ireland; Literature; Irish Literature; 20th Century"	"Ireland,Dublin(Ireland)"	"Maria,Bantam Lyons,John Corley,Fr.

They offer a unique glimpse into life on the American frontier, and tell the heartwarming, unforgettable story of a loving family.Little House in the Big WoodsMeet the Ingalls family—Laura, Ma, Pa, Mary, and baby Carrie, who all live in a cozy log cabin in the big woods of Wisconsin in the 1870s. Though many of their neighbors are wolves and panthers and bears, the woods feel like home, thanks to Ma’s homemade cheese and butter and the joyful sounds of Pa’s fiddle.Farmer BoyAs Laura Ingalls is growing up in a little house in Kansas, Almanzo Wilder lives on a big farm in New York. He and his brothers and sisters work hard from dawn to supper to help keep their family farm running. Almanzo wishes for just one thing—his very own horse—but he must prove that he is ready for such a big responsibility.Little House on the PrairieWhen Pa decides to sell the log house in the woods, the family packs up and moves from Wisconsin to Kansas, where Pa builds them their little house on the prairie! Living on the farm is different from living in the woods, but Laura and her family are kept busy and are happy with the promise of their new life on the prairie.On the Banks of Plum CreekThe Ingalls family lives in a sod house beside Plum Creek in Minnesota until Pa builds them a new house made of sawed lumber. The money for the lumber will come from their first wheat crop. But then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm, and by the end of a week, there is no wheat crop left.By the Shores of Silver LakePa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet. Pa starts work on the first building of the brand new town, located on the shores of Silver Lake.The Long WinterThe first terrible storm comes to the barren prairie in October. Then it snows almost without stopping until April.

Young Almanzo Wilder, who has settled in the town, risks his life to save the town.Little Town on the PrairieDe Smet is rejuvenated with the beginning of spring. But in addition to the parties, socials, and “literaries,” work must continue. Laura spends many hours sewing shirts to help Ma and Pa get enough money to send Mary to a college for the blind. But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder.These Happy Golden YearsLaura must continue to earn money to keep Mary in her college for the blind, so she gets a job as a teacher. It’s not easy, and for the first time she’s living away from home. But it gets a little better every Friday, when Almanzo picks Laura up to take her back home for the weekend. Though Laura is still young, she and Almanzo are officially courting, and she knows that this is a time for new beginnings.The First Four YearsLaura Ingalls and Almanzo Wilder have just been married! They move to a small prairie homestead to start their lives together. But each year brings new challenges—storms, sickness, fire, and unpaid debts. These first four years call for courage, strength, and a great deal of determination.

When she was fourteen years old, Maud wrote in her journal, "I love books. I hope when I grow up to be able to have lots of them." Not only did Maud grow up to own lots of books, she wrote twenty-four of them herself as L. M. Montgomery, the world-renowned author of Anne of Green Gables. For many years, not a great deal was known about Maud’s personal life. Her childhood was spent with strict, undemonstrative grandparents, and her reflections on writing, her lifelong struggles with anxiety and depression, her "year of mad passion," and her difficult married life remained locked away, buried deep within her unpublished personal journals. Through this revealing and deeply moving biography, kindred spirits of all ages who, like Maud, never gave up "the substance of things hoped for" will be captivated anew by the words of this remarkable woman.Show more"	"339"	"June 12, 2018"	"Nonfiction; Biography; Biography Memoir; History; Middle Grade; Memoir; Books About Books"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780763660574"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36369872-house-of-dreams"

At the time, Davis was a young, talented player who had been drafted by the 49ers in 2006 at number six, one of the highest draft positions for a tight end in NFL history. He played ten years for the team, which included a 2013 Super Bowl loss to the Baltimore Ravens in a 34-31 heartbreaker, where he recorded six catches for 104 yards. Winning a Super Bowl in 2016 with Peyton Manning, Davis landed a crucial downfield block and sprung teammate C.L. Anderson for a key 34-yard run that helped the Broncos defeat the Carolina Panthers 24-10. Davis retired in 2019 after a final four years playing pro for his hometown team in Washington. He’s now deeply involved in his new acting and producing feature films. Here he rewinds the tape to reflect on his career and competitive spirit—and the insights about teamwork, leadership, and responsibility that came in the aftermath of Coach Singletary’s press conference, spurring him to transform his life for the better. Weaving personal reflections with frank, real-world advice, Playing Ball is not just one athlete’s memoir but an eye-opening exploration of what winning—on the field and beyond—really means.Show more"	"240"	"August 20, 2024"	"Nonfiction; Biography Memoir; Biography; Memoir; Inspirational; Book Club; True Story"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781496746573"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202470606-playing-ball"

Sportswriter Terry Pluto profiles the colorful players who made that season so memorable,Pluto takes us through the entire 1964 season from training camp at Hiram College to the championship game in Municipal Stadium. Along the way he recreates an era and a team for which pride was not just a slogan.They were a team of men in the truest sense of the words, men who didn’t expect to be coddled, men who didn’t believe the world should genuflect at the mere mention of their names. They had the greatest running back in the history of football, and a coach who wore a hearing aid. Their quarterback had a Ph.D. in math. They had a defensive end who was a preacher, and a halfback who became a millionaire. Together, they won it all.Back before free agency, before shoe contracts and end zone dances, football was a tough game played by men who loved it. They had real jobs in the off season, as insurance salesmen or manufacturers’ representatives, and they lived in the community where they played. They were grateful to the fans for their support and believed that nothing they accomplished was important unless the team won."Pluto movingly reveals the substance of a mythic bond between men and a game, a team and a city—and thus lays bare how present-day pro football has surrendered its soul." — Kirkus ReviewsShow more"	"322"	"July 24, 2003"	"Biography Memoir; Memoir; Biography; Nonfiction; True Story; Book Club; Drama"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781886228726"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1170636.Browns_Town_1964"
"The Truth About Aaron: My Journey to Understand My Brother"	"None"	"Jonathan Hernández; Lars Anderson; Josh Bloomberg"	"4.01"	"1,795"	"146"	"5 Hours and 16 MinutesThe unvarnished true story of the tragic life and death of Aaron Hernandez, the college All-American and New England Patriots star convicted of murder, told by one of the few people who knew him best, his brother.To football fans, Aaron Hernandez was a superstar in the making. A standout at the University of Florida, he helped the Gators win the national title in 2008. Drafted by the New England Patriots, in his second full season with the team, he and fellow Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski set records for touchdowns and yardage, and, with Tom Brady, led New England to Super Bowl XLVI in 2012. But Aaron's NFL career ended as quickly as it began. On June 26, 2013, he was arrested at his North Attleboro home, charged with the murder of Odin Lloyd, and released by the Patriots. Convicted of first-degree murder, Aaron was sentenced to life in prison without parole. On May 15, 2014, while on trial for Lloyd's murder, Aaron was indicted for two more murders. Five days after being acquitted for those double murders, he committed suicide in his jail cell. Aaron Hernandez was twenty-seven years old.In this clear-eyed, emotionally devastating biography-a family memoir combining football and true crime-Jonathan (formerly known by his nickname DJ) Hernandez speaks out fully for the first time about the brother he knew. Jonathan draws on his own recollections as well as thousands of pages of prison letters and other sources to give us a full portrait of a star athlete and troubled young man who would become a murderer, and the darkness that consumed him. Jonathan does not portray Aaron as a victim; he does not lay the blame for his crimes on his illness. He speaks openly about Aaron's talent, his sexuality, his crimes and incarceration, and the CTE that ravaged him-scientists found that upon his death, Aaron had the brain of a sixty-seven-year old suffering from the same condition. Filled with headline-making revelations,The Truth About Aaronis a shocking and moving account of promise, tragedy, and loss-of one man's descent into rage and violence, as told by the person who knew him more closely than anyone else.Show more"	"Audio"	"October 30, 2018"	"Nonfiction; Biography; Memoir; True Crime; True Story; Biography Memoir; Drama"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781982554873"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40399753-the-truth-about-aaron"
"Montana: The Biography of Football's Joe Cool"	"None"	"Keith Dunnavant"	"4.06"	"695"	"27"	"As long as football is played, Joe Montana will be synonymous with the heart-pounding rally. Seemingly impervious to the pressure of a scoreboard deficit, the quarterback known as Joe Cool brought a steadying calm to every huddle, especially when the situation seemed especially dire. His reputation for miracles began to take root at the University of Notre Dame. In the 1979 Cotton Bowl, he overcame the flu, hypothermia and a 22-point deficit to lead the Fighting Irish to a stunning victory over Houston. This narrative continued in the NFL, as he engineered 31 fourth-quarter comebacks, including victories known in professional football lore as The Catch and The Drive, forever casting his career in a heroic glow.In MONTANA, acclaimed author Keith Dunnavant sketches the definitive portrait of a man who repeatedly defied the odds, on and off the field.While leading the San Francisco 49ers to four Super Bowl championships over a nine-year period, establishing a new standard for passing efficiency, and twice earning the league's Most Valuable Player award, Montana became the signature quarterback of the 1980s and one of the greatest ever to play the game. Overcoming his own limitations, which caused him to be underrated coming out of Notre Dame, he quickly mastered Bill Walsh's West Coast Offense, and thereby, helped reinvent offensive football.But it was rarely easy. Like the rallies he so often produced, his life was filled with the sort of tension that made his journey seem routinely dramatic: The father who pushed him. The high school coach who challenged his commitment. The college coach who very nearly squandered him. The back surgery that almost ended his career. The younger athlete who tried to take his job.Rich an anecdotal detail, insight and context, MONTANA is a powerful story about a man who was defined by his intense competitiveness, and how this intangible helped him become one of the ionic figures in football history.Show more"	"336"	"October 27, 2015"	"Biography; Sports; Nonfiction; Football; Inspirational; True Story; Memoir"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781250017840"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23847960-montana"

"Rick Riordan"	"None"	"Adam Furgang"	"4.67"	"1,381"	"6"	"Through his wildly popular series Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Kane Chronicles, 39 Clues, and The Heroes of Olympus, Rick Riordan has sparked young readers' interest in world mythology and literature, a renewed fascination that is reinforced by film adaptations, toys, games, and other "tie-ins." As a child, Riordan thought of books as too difficult to read and, in the end, not very interesting or worth the effort-in fact, he grew up as a reluctant reader who didn't like books. While Riordan eventually grew to love both reading and writing, it was a long journey for him. He has now found enormous success as a writer and storyteller. When he noticed his own young son struggling with reading, Riordan was able to capture his attention in the same way that he had finally been hooked through an interest in the otherworldly appeal of mythology. It was from these bedtime stories that he told to his son that the Percy Jackson series was born. The series not only helped to capture his son's imagination, but it started a very successful career for Riordan as a young adult writer. Today, not only do Percy Jackson fans eagerly await another movie installment of the bestselling books, but increasing hype surrounds the film adaptations of the Kane Chronicles and The 39 Clues, too. Behind all of these impressive tokens of fame and success lie very humble beginnings. The stories millions of children love today came from the mind of just one man. This is Riordan's inspiring story, one that is every bit as intriguing, dramatic, motivational, and full of unexpected twists and turns as any of his beloved and fantastical works of fiction. This volume includes fact sheets on the author and his work, a timeline, and critical reviews.Show more"	"111"	"July 30, 2012"	"Biography"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781448869374"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14498748-rick-riordan"

How, she asks, can we learn from Indigenous wisdom and the plant world to reimagine what we value most? Our economy is rooted in scarcity, competition, and the hoarding of resources, and we have surrendered our values to a system that actively harms what we love. Meanwhile, the Serviceberry’s relationship with the natural world is an embodiment of interconnectedness and gratitude. The tree distributes its wealth—its abundance of sweet, juicy berries—to meet the needs of its natural community. And this distribution ensures its own survival. As Kimmerer explains, “Serviceberries show us another model, one based upon reciprocity, rather than accumulation, where wealth and security come from the quality of your relationships, not from the illusion of self-sufficiency.”As Elizabeth Gilbert writes, Robin Wall Kimmerer is “a great teacher, and her words are a hymn of love to the world.”The Serviceberryis an antidote to the broken relationships and misguided goals of our times and a reminder that “Hoarding won’t save us. . . .

Though she comes from a long line of witches, the only magic she possesses is the ability to see ghosts, which is rarely as useful as one would think.

The perfect mark. When he offers Mallory a large sum of money to rid his ancestral home of Le Bleu's ghost, she can’t resist. A paid vacation at Armand’s country manor? It’s practically a dream come true, never mind the ghosts of murdered wives and the monsters that are as common as household pests.But when murder again comes to the House Saphir, Mallory finds herself at the center of the investigation—and she is almost certain the killer is mortal. If she has any hope of cashing in on the payment she was promised, she’ll have to solve the murder and banish the ghost, all while upholding the illusion of witchcraft.But that all sounds relatively easy compared to her biggest learning to trust her heart.

Jego wygląd oraz słowa przejmują strachem początkowo tylko dzieci, jednak wkrótce niepokój zaczyna ogarniać także samego gospodarza.

Soon their attempts turn desperate, subjecting first her mind, and then her body, to ever more intrusive and perverse violations, sending Yeong-hye spiraling into a dangerous, bizarre estrangement, not only from those closest to her, but also from herself.Celebrated by critics around the world, The Vegetarian is a darkly allegorical, Kafka-esque tale of power, obsession, and one woman’s struggle to break free from the violence both without and within her.Show more"	"158"	"February 2, 2016"	"Fiction; Horror; Contemporary; Literary Fiction; Book Club; Asia; Audiobook"	"Seoul, South Korea(Korea, Republic of),South Korea(Korea, Republic of)"	"Kim Yeong-hye,Kim In-hye,Mr. Cheong"	"9780553448184"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489025-the-vegetarian"

Es la mejor amiga de Marta a los siete años: la amiga invisible que, en esos momentos en que las cosas no salen como había planeado y ni siquiera la abuela es capaz de consolarla, se sienta con ella y espera hasta que se le pase. Belaundia Fu es la voz sensata, ideal e infalible que, cuando Marta tiene dieciséis años y pese a que prefiera no escucharlas, le dice las verdades a la cara: por ejemplo, que ese chico, Charlie, no le conviene. Pero cuando Marta ya ha cumplido veintidós, cuando ya se ha licenciado, cuando está empezando a tomar las decisiones que van a marcar el resto de su vida, ¿qué hace aún ahí Belaundia Fu? Ahí sigue porque es quien, desde siempre, le narra a Marta su propia historia. ¿Quién es Belaundia Fu?, nos preguntamos; y, sin embargo, la pregunta que verdaderamente importa es: ¿quién es Marta? Luminosa y emocionante, Los nombres propios es una indagación sobre la identidad y la relación que establecemos con el mundo que nos rodea.

En realidad, ¿fui suficientemente agradecida? ¿Le mostré mi agradecimiento como se merecía? ¿Estuve a su lado cuando me necesitó, le hice compañía, fui constante?», reflexiona Marie, una de las narradoras de este libro. Su voz se alterna con la de Jérôme, que trabaja en un geriátrico y nos cuenta: «Soy logopeda. Trabajo con las palabras y con el silencio. Con lo que no se dice. Trabajo con la vergüenza, con los secretos, con los remordimientos. Trabajo con la ausencia, con los recuerdos que ya no están y con los que resurgen tras un nombre, una imagen, un perfume. Trabajo con el dolor de ayer y con el de hoy. Con las confidencias. Y con el miedo a morir. Forma parte de mi oficio.»A ambos personajes –Marie y Jérôme– los une su relación con Michka Seld, una anciana cuyos últimos meses de vida nos relatan estas dos voces cruzadas. Marie es su vecina: cuando era niña y su madre se ausentaba, Michka cuidaba de ella. Jérôme es el logopeda que intenta que la anciana, que acaba de ser ingresada en un geriátrico, recupere aunque sea parcialmente el habla, que va perdiendo por culpa de una afasia.Y ambos personajes se involucrarán en el último deseo de Michka: encontrar al matrimonio que, durante los años de la ocupación alemana, la salvó de morir en un campo de exterminio acogiéndola y ocultándola en su casa. Nunca les dio las gracias y ahora querría mostrarles su gratitud...Escrita con un estilo contenido, casi austero, esta narración a dos voces nos habla de la memoria, el pasado, el envejecimiento, las palabras, la bondad y la gratitud hacia aquellos que fueron importantes en nuestras vidas. Son las respectivas gratitudes las que unen a los tres inolvidables personajes cuyas historias se entrelazan en esta conmovedora y deslumbrante novela.Show more"	"176"	"February 10, 2021"	"Fiction; France; Contemporary; Roman; Audiobook; Drama; Novels"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9788433980830"	"Spanish; Castilian"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56591408-las-gratitudes"

Rodeado de paisajes bellos a la par que violentos y a través de una oralidad descarnada, maleducada, y un cántabru tosco y fiero, el protagonista de esta historia habla de la brutalidad silenciosa de un pueblo desamparado, que cala poco a poco en su gente sin que ni siquiera se den cuenta, mientras trata de encontrar a su hermana antes de que llegue la pleamar.Han tenido que pasar varios años para que Luis Mario se diera cuenta de que vivía empapado y, una vez seco, ha podido escribir sobre la Mujer Oso, el Hombre Pez, mujeres que amamantan a perros, hombres que destripan vacas y vacas que caen al mar.

Never was their family tradition more important than seven decades earlier, during the Second World War, when Annabel and Colette worked side by side in Paris to fund the French Resistance.But one night in 1942, it all went wrong. Annabel was arrested by the Germans, and Colette’s four-year-old sister, Liliane, disappeared in the chaos of the raid, along with an exquisite diamond bracelet sewn into the hem of her nightgown for safekeeping. Soon after, Annabel was executed, and Liliane’s body was found floating in the Seine—but the bracelet was nowhere to be found.Seventy years later, Colette—who has “redistributed” $30 million in jewels over the decades to fund many worthy organizations—has done her best to put her tragic past behind her, but her life begins to unravel when the long-missing bracelet suddenly turns up in a museum exhibit in Boston. If Colette can discover where it has been all this time—and who owns it now—she may finally learn the truth about what happened to her sister. But she isn’t the only one for whom the bracelet holds answers, and when someone from her childhood lays claim to the diamonds, she’s forced to confront the ghosts of her past as never before. Against all odds, there may still be a chance to bring a murderer to justice—but first, Colette will have to summon the courage to open her own battered heart.Show more"	"384"	"June 17, 2025"	"Historical Fiction; Fiction; Mystery; Audiobook; Historical; World War II; Book Club"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781982191733"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220160204-the-stolen-life-of-colette-marceau"

From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons,Treasure Islandis, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S.

Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read.Gulliver's Travels describes the four voyages of Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon. In Lilliput he discovers a world in miniature; towering over the people and their city, he is able to view their society from the viewpoint of a god. However, in Brobdingnag, a land of giants, tiny Gulliver himself comes under observation, exhibited as a curiosity at markets and fairs. In Laputa, a flying island, he encounters a society of speculators and projectors who have lost all grip on everyday reality; while they plan and calculate, their country lies in ruins. Gulliver's final voyage takes him to the land of the Houyhnhnms, gentle horses whom he quickly comes to admire - in contrast to the Yahoos, filthy bestial creatures who bear a disturbing resemblance to humans. This text, based on the first edition of 1726, reproduces all the original illustrations and includes an introduction by Robert Demaria, Jr, which discusses the ways Gulliver's Travels has been interpreted since its first publication.

In the words of one contemporary, it divided the world into two different Parties, Pamelists and Anti-pamelists, even eclipsing the sensational factional politics of the day.Preached for its morality, and denounced as pornography in disguise, it vividly describes a young servant's long resistance to the attempts of her predatory master to seduce her. Written in the voice of its low-born heroine, Pamela is not only a work of pioneering psychological complexity, but also a compelling and provocative study of power and its abuse.Based on the original text of 1740, from which Richardson later retreated in a series of defensive revisions, this edition makes available the version of Pamela that aroused such widespread controversy on its first appearance.Show more"	"592"	"July 12, 2001"	"Classics; Fiction; 18th Century; Romance; Literature; School; British Literature"	"England(, 1735),Bedfordshire, England,Lincolnshire, England"	"Pamela Andrews,Mr. B,Mr. Williams,Lady Davers,Mrs. Jervis,Mrs. Jewkes"	"9780192829603"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/417549.Pamela"

Fielding's far more spirited and sexually honest heroine, by contrast, merely uses coyness and mock modesty as techniques to catch a rich husband. Joseph Andrews, Fielding's first full-length novel, can also be seen as a response to Richardson, as the lascivious Lady Booby sets out to seduce her comically chaste servant Joseph, (himself in love with the much-put-upon Fanny Goodwill). As in Tom Jones, Fielding takes a huge cast of characters out on the road and exposes them to many colourful and often hilarious adventures.Show more"	"390"	"January 1, 1999"	"Classics; Fiction; 18th Century; Literature; School; Humor; British Literature"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780140433869"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/110171.Joseph_Andrews_Shamela"

After gaining admission to Oxford, and moving to the United States to become a journalist, through several love affairs, then marriage and family, Mead read and rereadMiddlemarch. The novel, which Virginia Woolf famously described as "one of the few English novels written for grown-up people," offered Mead something that modern life and literature did not.In this wise and revealing work of biography, reporting, and memoir, Rebecca Mead leads us into the life that the book made for her, as well as the many lives the novel has led since it was written. Employing a structure that deftly mirrors that of the novel,My Life in Middlemarchtakes the themes of Eliot's masterpiece--the complexity of love, the meaning of marriage, the foundations of morality, and the drama of aspiration and failure--and brings them into our world. Offering both a fascinating reading of Eliot's biography and an exploration of the way aspects of Mead's life uncannily echo that of Eliot herself.Show more"	"293"	"January 1, 2014"	"Nonfiction; Memoir; Biography; Books About Books; Literary Criticism; Classics; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780307984760"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17883928-my-life-in-middlemarch"
"The Marriage Question: George Eliot's Double Life"	"None"	"Clare Carlisle"	"4.14"	"404"	"90"	"A startling new portrait of George Eliot, the beloved novelist and a rare philosophical mind who explored the complexities of marriage.In her mid-thirties, Marian Evans transformed herself into George Eliot―an author celebrated for her genius as soon as she published her debut novel. During those years she also found her life partner, George Lewes―writer, philosopher, and married father of three. After “eloping” to Berlin in 1854, they lived together for twenty-four years: Eliot asked people to call her "Mrs Lewes" and dedicated each novel to her "Husband." Though they could not legally marry, she felt herself initiated into the "great experience" of marriage―"this double life, which helps me to feel and think with double strength." The relationship scandalized her contemporaries yet she grew immeasurably within it. Living at once inside and outside marriage, Eliot could experience this form of life―so familiar yet also so perplexing―from both sides.In The Marriage Question , Clare Carlisle reveals Eliot to be not only a great artist but also a brilliant philosopher who probes the tensions and complexities of a shared life. Through the immense ambition and dark marriage plots of her novels, we see Eliot wrestling―in art and in life―with themes of desire and sacrifice, motherhood and creativity, trust and disillusion, destiny and chance. Carlisle's searching new biography explores how marriage questions grow and change, and joins Eliot in her struggle to marry thought and feeling.Includes black-and-white imagesShow more"	"400"	"August 15, 2023"	"Biography; Nonfiction; History; Philosophy; Literature; Womens; Biography Memoir"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780374600457"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62039167-the-marriage-question"

Gwendolen's attempts to escape a sadistic relationship and atone for past actions catalyse her friendship with Deronda, while his search for origins leads him, via Judaism, to a quest for moral growth.Eliot's radical dual narrative constantly challenges all solutions and ensures that the novel is as controversial now, as when it first appeared.Show more"	"796"	"January 1, 2002"	"Classics; Fiction; 19th Century; Victorian; Historical Fiction; Literature; British Literature"	"England(, 1865)"	"Daniel Deronda,Gwendolen Harleth,Mirah Lapidoth,Sir Hugo Mallinger,Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt"	"9780375760136"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/304.Daniel_Deronda"

She thinks she sees through everyone and rules over a family of dependents with knowing cynicism. But there are two people in Redborough who resist her. One is Hester, a young relation with a personality as strong as Catherine's, and as determined to find a role for herself. The other is Edward, who Catherine treats like a son. Conflict between the young and the old is inevitable, and in its depiction of the complex relationships that develop between the three principal characters, Hester is a masterpiece of psychological realism. In exploring the difficulty of understanding human nature, it is also a compulsive story of financial and sexual risk-taking that inevitably results in a searing climax.Margaret Oliphant is one of the great Victorian novelists, and this edition re-establishes her importance.Show more"	"512"	"December 18, 2003"	"Classics; Victorian; Fiction; 19th Century; British Literature; Literary Fiction; Audiobook"	"England"	"Catherine Vernon,John Vernon"	"9780192804112"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/882162.Hester"
"Dr. Wortle's School"	"None"	"Anthony Trollope; Mick Imlah"	"3.88"	"1,136"	"183"	"Mr Peacocke, a Classical scholar, has come to Broughtonshire with his beautiful American wife to live as a schoolmaster. But when the blackmailing brother of her American first husband appears at the school gates, their dreadful secret is revealed, and the county is scandalized. In the character of Dr Wortle, the combative but warm-hearted headmaster, who takes the couple's part in the face of general ostracism, there is an element of self-portrait. There are echoes, too, in Wortle's gallantry to Mrs Peacocke, of Trollope's own attachment to the vivacious Bostonian, Kate Field. With its scathing depiction of American manhood, its jousting with convention and its amiable, egotistical protagonist, Dr Wortle's School (1879) is one of the sharpest and most engaging of Trollope's later novels.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

It is followed by Crito, in which Socrates' friend offers to spirit him out of Athens to avoid execution. Among the others are discussions on Courage (Laches), and Friendship (Lysis).The role of Socrates is taken by David Rintoul, a widely admired and experienced audiobook reader who studied philosophy at university before taking a different path to RADA, TV, theatre and film.

Reason, Kant argues, is the seat of certain concepts that precede experience and make it possible, but we are not therefore entitled to draw conclusions about the natural world from these concepts.

The Introduction, written before the rest of the work, summarizes and completes Kant's ideas on skepticism by rendering it moot and encouraging idealism and self-realization. The body of the work is divided into six sections of varying length, entitled "Consciousness," "Self-Consciousness," "Reason," "Spirit," "Religion," and "Absolute Knowledge." A myriad of topics are discussed, and explained in such a harmoniously complex way that the method has been termed Hegelian dialectic.

In 1949, four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, meet weekly to play mahjong and tell stories of what they left behind in China. United in loss and new hope for their daughters' futures, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Their daughters, who have never heard these stories, think their mothers' advice is irrelevant to their modern American lives – until their own inner crises reveal how much they've unknowingly inherited of their mothers' pasts.With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. Tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery.Show more"	"288"	"September 21, 2006"	"Fiction; Historical Fiction; Classics; China; Contemporary; Book Club; Historical"	"San Francisco, California(United States),San Francisco, California(United States, 1984),China"	"Suyuan Woo,June Woo,Lindo Jong,Waverly Jong,An-Mei Hsu,Rose Hsu Jordan,Ying-Ying St. Clair,Lena St. Clair"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7763.The_Joy_Luck_Club"

It was the first novel by a Georgia author to win a Pulitzer, soon followed by Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind in 1937. In fact, Lamb was largely responsible for the discovery of Gone With the Wind; after reading Miller's novel, Macmillan editor Harold S. Latham sought other southern novels and authors, and found Margaret Mitchell.Caroline Miller was fascinated by the other Old South—not the romantic inhabitants of Gone With the Wind, but rather the poor people of the south Georgia backwoods, who never owned a slave or planned to fight a war. The story of Cean and Lonzo, a young couple who begin their married lives two decades before the Civil War, Lamb in His Bosom is a fascinating account of social customs and material realities among settlers of the Georgia frontier. At the same time, Lamb in His Bosom transcends regional history as Miller's quietly lyrical prose style pays poignant tribute to a woman's life lived close to nature—the nature outside her and the nature within.Show more"	"357"	"January 1, 1993"	"Fiction; Historical Fiction; Classics; Southern; Historical; Literature; Literary Fiction"	"Georgia(United States)"	"Cean Smith"	"9781561450749"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/267478.Lamb_in_His_Bosom"
"Now in November"	"None"	"Josephine Winslow Johnson; Nancy Hoffman"	"3.73"	"2,290"	"303"	"Brilliant, evocative, poetic, savage, this Pulitzer Prize-winning first novel (1934) written when Josephine Winslow Johnson was only 24, depicts a white, middle-class urban family that is turned into dirt-poor farmers by the Depression and the great drought of the thirties. The novel moves through a single year and, at the same time, a decade of years, from the spring arrival of the family at their mortgaged farm to the winter 10 years later, when the ravages of drought, fire, and personal anguish have led to the deaths of two of the five. LikeEthan Frome, the relatively brief, intense story evokes the torment possible among people isolated and driven by strong feelings of love and hate that, unexpressed, lead inevitably to doom. Reviewers in the thirties praised the novel, calling its prose "profoundly moving music," expressing incredulity "that this mature style and this mature point of view are those of a young woman in her twenties," comparing the book to "the luminous work of Willa Cather," and, with prescience, suggesting that it "has that rare quality of timelessness which is the mark of first-rate fiction."Show more"	"288"	"January 1, 1993"	"Fiction; Classics; Historical Fiction; Literary Fiction; 20th Century; Historical; Novels"	"The United States of America"	"Unknown"	"9781558610354"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/267115.Now_in_November"

From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons,Treasure Islandis, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S.

A Treasury officer has disappeared into thin air—abducted from his quarters while the door and windows remained locked from the inside, in a building whose entrances and exits are all under constant guard.To solve the case, the Empire calls on its most brilliant and mercurial investigator, the great Ana Dolabra. At her side, as always, is her bemused assistant Dinios Kol.Before long, Ana’s discovered that they’re not investigating a disappearance, but a murder—and that the killing was just the first chess move by an adversary who seems to be able to pass through warded doors like a ghost, and who can predict every one of Ana’s moves as though they can see the future.Worse still, the killer seems to be targeting the high-security compound known as the Shroud. Here, the Empire's greatest minds dissect fallen Titans to harness the volatile magic found in their blood. Should it fall, the destruction would be terrible indeed—and the Empire itself will grind to a halt, robbed of the magic that allows its wheels of power to turn.Din has seen Ana solve impossible cases before.

"The Guide to James Joyce's Ulysses"	"None"	"Patrick Hastings"	"4.47"	"445"	"84"	"From the creator of UlyssesGuide.com, this essential guide to James Joyce's masterpiece weaves together plot summaries, interpretive analyses, scholarly perspectives, and historical and biographical context to create an easy-to-read, entertaining, and thorough review of Ulysses . In The Guide to James Joyce's 'Ulysses ,' Patrick Hastings provides comprehensive support to readers of Joyce's magnum opus by illuminating crucial details and reveling in the mischievous genius of this unparalleled novel. Written in a voice that offers encouragement and good humor, this guidebook maintains a closeness to the original text and supports the first-time reader of Ulysses with the information needed to successfully finish and appreciate the novel. Deftly weaving together spirited plot summaries, helpful interpretive analyses, scholarly criticism, and explanations of historical and biographical context, Hastings makes Joyce's famously intimidating novel―one that challenges the conventions and limits of language―more accessible and enjoyable than ever before. He unpacks each chapter of Ulysses with episode guides, which offer pointed and readable explanations of what occurs in the text. He also deals adroitly with many of the puzzles Joyce hoped would "keep the professors busy for centuries." Full of practical resources―including maps, explanations of the old British system of money, photos of places and things mentioned in the text, annotated bibliographies, and a detailed chronology of Bloomsday (June 16, 1904―the single day on which Ulysses is set)―this is an invaluable first resource about a work of art that celebrates the strength of spirit required to endure the trials of everyday existence. The Guide to James Joyce's 'Ulysses' is perfect for anyone undertaking a reading of Joyce's novel, whether as a student, a member of a reading group, or a lover of literature finally crossing this novel off the bucket list.Show more"	"316"	"February 1, 2022"	"Nonfiction; Literary Criticism; Literature; Classics; Criticism; Ireland; Books About Books"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781421443492"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59662530-the-guide-to-james-joyce-s-ulysses"

"The Hurting Kind: Poems"	"None"	"Ada Limon"	"4.32"	"7,761"	"1,223"	"An astonishing collection about interconnectedness—between the human and nonhuman, ancestors and ourselves—from National Book Critics Circle Award winner and National Book Award finalist Ada Limón.“I have always been too sensitive, a weeper / from a long line of weepers,” writes Limón. “I am the hurting kind.” What does it mean to be the hurting kind? To be sensitive not only to the world’s pain and joys, but to the meanings that bend in the scrim between the natural world and the human world? To divine the relationships between us all? To perceive ourselves in other beings—and to know that those beings are resolutely their own, that they “do not / care to be seen as symbols”?With Limón’s remarkable ability to trace thought,The Hurting Kindexplores those questions—incorporating others’ stories and ways of knowing, making surprising turns, and always reaching a place of startling insight. These poems slip through the seasons, teeming with horses and kingfishers and the gleaming eyes of fish. And they honor parents, stepparents, and grandparents: the sacrifices made, the separate lives lived, the tendernesses extended to a hurting child; the abundance, in retrospect, of having two families.Along the way, we glimpse loss. There are flashes of the pandemic, ghosts whose presence manifests in unexpected memories and the mysterious behavior of pets left behind. ButThe Hurting Kindis filled, above all, with connection and the delight of being in the world. “Slippery and waddle thieving my tomatoes still / green in the morning’s shade,” writes Limón of a groundhog in her garden, “she is doing what she can to survive.”Show more"	"100"	"May 10, 2022"	"Poetry; Nonfiction; Nature; Audiobook; Adult; Latinx; American"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781639550494"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59571658-the-hurting-kind"

Poems confront craving, control, the constant battle of alcoholism and sobriety, and the questioning of the self and its instincts within the context of this never-ending fight.“InCalling a Wolf a Wolf, Kaveh Akbar exquisitely and tenaciously braids astonishment and atonement into a singular lyric voice. The desolation of alcoholism widens into hard-won insight: ‘the body is a mosque borrowed from Heaven.’ Doubt and fear spiral into grace and beauty. Akbar’s mind, like his language, is perpetually in motion. His imagery—wounded and resplendent—is masterful and his syntax ensnares and releases music that’s both delicate and muscular. Kaveh Akbar has crafted one of the best debuts in recent memory. In his hands, awe and redemption hinge into unforgettable and gorgeous poems.” —Eduardo C.

Brute arises, brave and furious, from the dissolution of a relationship, showing how such endings necessitate self-discovery and reinvention. The speaker of these poems is a sorceress, a bride, a warrior, a lover, both object and agent, ricocheting among ways of knowing and being known. Each incarnation squares itself up against ideas of feminine virtue and sin, strength and vulnerability, love and rage, as it closes in on a hard-won freedom.Brute is absolutely sure of its capacity to insist not only on the truth of what it says but on the truth of its right to say it. “What am I supposed to I’m free ?” the first poem asks. The rest of the poems emphatically discover new ways to answer.

These poems conjure encounters with figures from scriptures, domesticated animals eyeing the wild, and mothering as a shapeshifting, spectral force; they question what it means to love another person and how to exorcise childhood fears. All the while, the Deep South haunts, and no matter how far away the speaker moves, the South always draws her back home.In confession, in illumination, Bates establishes herself as an unflinching witness to the risks that desire necessitates, asJudas Goatholds readers close and whispers its unforgettable lines.Show more"	"104"	"January 24, 2023"	"Poetry; Feminism; Womens; Religion; Nonfiction; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781953534644"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61340224-judas-goat"
"I Do Everything I'm Told"	"None"	"Megan Fernandes"	"4.08"	"1,187"	"248"	"Restless, contradictory, and witty, Megan Fernandes’I Do Everything I’m Toldexplores disobedience and worship, longing and possessiveness, and nights of wandering cities. Its poems span thousands of miles, as a masterful crown of sonnets starts in Shanghai, then moves through Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Lisbon, Palermo, Paris, and Philadelphia—with a speaker who travels solo, adventures with strangers, struggles with the parameters of sexuality, and speculates on desire.Across four sections, poems navigate the terrain of queer, normative, and ambiguous intimacies with a frank intelligence: “It’s better to be illegible, sometimes. Then they can’t govern you.” Strangers, ancestors, priests, ghosts, the inner child, sisters, misfit raccoons, Rimbaud, and Rilke populate the pages. Beloveds are unnamed, and unrealized desires are grieved as actual losses. The poems are grounded in real cities, but also in a surrealist past or an impossible future, in cliché love stories made weird, in ordinary routines made divine, and in the cosmos itself, sitting on Saturn’s rings looking back at Earth. When things go wrong, Fernandes treats loss with a sacred irreverence: “Contradictions are a sign we are from god. We fall. We don’t always get to ask why.”Show more"	"104"	"June 20, 2023"	"Poetry; Queer; LGBT; Contemporary; Nonfiction; Literary Fiction; 21st Century"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781953534880"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62972520-i-do-everything-i-m-told"

Among the gloriously vivid cast of characters he encounters are his tyrannical stepfather, Mr Murdstone; his brilliant, but ultimately unworthy school-friend James Steerforth; his formidable aunt, Betsey Trotwood; the eternally humble, yet treacherous Uriah Heep; frivolous, enchanting Dora Spenlow; and the magnificently impecunious Wilkins Micawber, one of literature's great comic creations. In David Copperfield - the novel he described as his 'favourite child' - Dickens drew revealingly on his own experiences to create one of the most exuberant and enduringly popular works, filled with tragedy and comedy in equal measure. This edition uses the text of the first volume publication of 1850, and includes updated suggestions for further reading, original illustrations by 'Phiz', a revised chronology and expanded notes. In his new introduction, Jeremy Tambling discusses the novel's autobiographical elements, and its central themes of memory and identity.Show more"	"882"	"January 1, 2004"	"Classics; Fiction; Literature; Historical Fiction; Audiobook; 19th Century; Novels"	"Great Yarmouth, England(United Kingdom),London, England,Canterbury, Kent, England,England,Kent, England(United Kingdom),United Kingdom"	"Richard Babley,David Copperfield,Uriah Heep,Wilkins  Micawber,Edward Murdstone,Daniel Peggotty,Ham Peggotty,James Steerforth,Thomas Traddles,Mr. Wickfield,Clara Copperfield Murdstone,Rosa Dartle,Mrs. Gummidge,Emma Micawber,Jane Murdstone,Clara Peggotty,Dora Spenlow,Betsey Trotwood,Agnes Wickfield,Little Em'ly"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58696.David_Copperfield"

Now he is a garden.”Death and the Gardenertraces the final month of a father’s life, a dying father in a dying world. His son Georgi, the narrator, reports both radically and gently from those end times. The novel unfolds also as a history of the father’s generation—born in Bulgaria at the end of World War II, “often absent, clinging to the snorkel of a cigarette, swimming in different waters and clouds.” What kept the old man down to earth was his garden, turning after his departure into a place of ultimate loss but also of consolation, where he would live on in the first tulips of spring. With striking acuity, Georgi Gospodinov explores the peculiar reality of taming grief through storytelling. Masterfully translated by Angela Rodel, this is another profoundly moving novel from “one of the indispensable writers of our times” (International Booker Prize Jury).Show more"	"224"	"October 7, 2025"	"Fiction; Bulgarian Literature; Bulgaria; Audiobook; Literary Fiction; Contemporary; Novels"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781324097297"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223736245-death-and-the-gardener"

Medea, in which a spurned woman takes revenge upon her lover by killing her children, is one of the most shocking of all the Greek tragedies. Medea is a towering figure who demonstrates Euripides' unusual willingness to give voice to a woman's case. Alcestis is based on a magical myth in which Death is overcome, and The Children of Heracles examines conflict between might and right, while Hippolytus deals with self-destructive integrity."

"The Pianist: The Extraordinary Story of One Man's Survival in Warsaw, 1939–45"	"None"	"Władysław Szpilman; Anthea Bell"	"4.25"	"80,271"	"1,961"	"The last live broadcast on Polish Radio, on September 23, 1939, was Chopin's Nocturne in C# Minor, played by a young pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman, until his playing was interrupted by German shelling. It was the same piece and the same pianist, when broadcasting was resumed six years later.The Pianistis Szpilman's account of the years inbetween, of the death and cruelty inflicted on the Jews of Warsaw and on Warsaw itself, related with a dispassionate restraint borne of shock. Szpilman, now 88, has not looked at his description since he wrote it in 1946 (the same time as Primo Levi'sIf This Is A Man?; it is too personally painful. The rest of us have no such excuse.Szpilman's family were deported to Treblinka, where they were exterminated; he survived only because a music-loving policeman recognised him. This was only the first in a series of fatefully lucky escapes that littered his life as he hid among the rubble and corpses of the Warsaw Ghetto, growing thinner and hungrier, yet condemned to live. Ironically it was a German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, who saved Szpilman's life by bringing food and an eiderdown to the derelict ruin where he discovered him. Hosenfeld died seven years later in a Stalingrad labour camp, but portions of his diary, reprinted here, tell of his outraged incomprehension of the madness and evil he witnessed, thereby establishing an effective counterpoint to ground the nightmarish vision of the pianist in a desperate reality. Szpilman originally published his account in Poland in 1946, but it was almost immediately withdrawn by Stalin's Polish minions as it unashamedly described collaborations by Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Poles and Jews with the Nazis. In 1997 it was published in Germany after Szpilman's son found it on his father's bookcase. This admirably robust translation by Anthea Bell is the first in the English language. There were 3,500,000 Jews in Poland before the Nazi occupation; after it there were 240,000. Wladyslaw Szpilman's extraordinary account of his own miraculous survival offers a voice across the years for the faceless millions who lost their lives. --David VincentShow more"	"222"	"January 1, 1999"	"Nonfiction; History; Holocaust; Biography; Memoir; War; World War II"	"Warsaw(Poland),Poland(, 1939)"	"Władysław Szpilman"	"9780575067080"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128066.The_Pianist"

This is a completely new society, a real civil society, which otherwise in the capitalist system is only a utopia. In this book, I scrutinize the principles of scientific socialism; i.e., all those principles of Marxism concerning the state that build socialism as a political system.The second book, The Economic Theory of Socialism, is a sequel, and as far as I know, the only sequel of the greatest work by Karl Marx – Capital. The economics of socialism makes Marx’s socialism already completely possible. In this book, I scrutinize the economic laws that build socialism as a more effective economic system than capitalism. These laws are extracted from Marx’s main work – Capital.From 1917 to 1991, the totalitarian system in USSR and East Europe was called socialism, and even by the scientific nonsense and absurd names of communism and communist system. In this system, the official ideology was allegedly Marxism, but really it could not endure any Marxist criticism. There was never any socialism anywhere!In the twentieth century, we passed through a system of utopian socialism as proof that this was not socialism that was not possible, but for the utopia of writers before and after Marx. We were visited by a utopian socialism, which at the contemporary stage is simply capitalism – state, monopolistic.There is no better application of Keynes’s doctrine than the “socialism” of the twentieth century.

The problem has never been discussed so profoundly and passionately as in this essay by Frederic Bastiat from 1850. The essay might have been written today.

"The Rape of the Mind: The Psychology of Thought Control, Menticide, and Brainwashing"	"None"	"Joost A.M. Meerloo"	"4.19"	"1,062"	"145"	"SINCE 1933, when a completely drugged and trial-conditioned human wreck confessed to having started the Reichstag fire in Berlin, Dr. Joost A. M. Meerloo has studied the methods by which systematic mental pressure brings people to abject submission, and by which totalitarians imprint their subjective "truth" on their victims' minds. The first two and one-half years of World War II, Dr. Meerloo spent under the pressure of Nazi-occupied Holland, witnessing at firsthand the Nazi methods of mental torture .on more than one occasion. During this time he was able to use his psychiatric and psychoanalytic knowledge to treat some of the victims. Then, after personal experiences with enforced interrogation, he escaped from a Nazi prison and certain death to England, where he was able, as Chief of the Psychological Department of the Netherlands Forces, to observe and study coercive methods officially. In this capacity he had to investigate not only traitors and collaborators, but also those members of the Resistance who had gone through the utmost of mental pressure. Later, as High Commissioner for Welfare, he came in closer contact with those who had gone through physical and mental torture. After the war, he came to the United States, where his war experiences would not permit him to concentrate solely on his psychiatric practice, but compelled him to go beyond purely medical aspects to the social aspects of the problem. As more and more cases of thought control, brainwashing, and mental coercion were disclosed - Cardinal Mindszenty, Colonel Schwable, Robert Vogeler, and others - his interest grew. It was Dr. Meerloo who coined the word menticide, the killing of the spirit, for this peculiar crime. His knowledge of these totalitarian procedures has been officially acknowledged; he served as an expert witness in the case of Colonel Schwable, the Marine Corps officer who, after months of subjection to physical and mental torture following his capture in Korea, was made to confess to having taken part in germ warfare. It is Dr. Meerloo's position that through pressure on the weak points in men's makeup, totalitarian methods can turn anyone into a "traitor." And in The Rape of the Mind he goes far beyond the direct military implications of mental torture to describing how our own culture unobtrusively shows symptoms of pressurizing people's minds. He presents a systematic analysis of the methods of brainwashing and mental torture and coercion, and shows how totalitarian strategy, with its use of mass psychology, leads to systematized "rape of the mind." He describes the new age of cold war with its mental terror, verbocracy, and semantic fog, the use of fear as a tool of mass submission and the problem of treason and loyalty, so loaded with dangerous confusion.

Today, three decades later, it is clear that it was not. While Russia may no longer be Communist, Communism and sympathy for Communist ideas have proliferated across the globe.    In To Overthrow the World, Sean McMeekin investigates the evolution of Communism from a seductive ideal of a classless society into the ruling doctrine of tyrannical regimes. Tracing Communism’s ascent from theory to practice, McMeekin ranges from Karl Marx’s writings to the rise and fall of the USSR under Stalin to Mao’s rise to power in China to the acceleration of Communist or Communist-inspired policies around the world in the twenty-first century. McMeekin argues, however, that despite the endurance of Communism, it remains deeply unpopular as a political form. Where it has arisen, it has always arisen by force.    Blending historical narrative with cutting-edge scholarship, To Overthrow the World revolutionizes our understanding of the evolution of Communism—an idea that seemingly cannot die.Show more"	"544"	"September 10, 2024"	"History; Politics; Nonfiction; Russia; Philosophy; Economics; China"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781541601963"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204593674-to-overthrow-the-world"

The principles of individual liberty, the rule of law, government by consent of the people, and the right to private property are taken for granted as fundamental to the human condition now. Most liberal theorists writing today look back to Locke as the source of their ideas. Some maintain that religious fundamentalism, "post-modernism," and socialism are today the only remaining ideological threats to liberalism. To the extent that this is true, these ideologies are ultimately attacks on the ideas that Locke, arguably more than any other, helped to make the universal vocabulary of political discourse.Show more"	"124"	"June 1, 1980"	"Philosophy; Politics; Nonfiction; Classics; Political Science; History; School"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780915144860"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/448836.Second_Treatise_of_Government"

[David Mura’s] first novel is a tour de luminously written and by turns crafty, tough, wise, and joyful.”—Junot Díaz Ben Ohara is the sole surviving member his family. A troubled and brilliant astrophysicist, Ben’s younger brother has mysteriously vanished in the Mojave Desert. His father, one of a small group of WWII draft resisters (known as the No-No Boys) during the internment of Japanese Americans, committed suicide when Ben was young. And his mother, whose wish to escape the past was as strong as his father’s ties to it, has died with her secrets. Now struggling to support his wife and children and under pressure to complete his historical study, Famous Suicides of the Japanese Empire , Ben realizes that the key to unlocking the future lies in reassessing the past. As Ben vividly recalls a childhood colored by the tough Chicago streets, horror movie monsters, sci-fi villains, Japanese folktales, and TV war heroes, he begins to understand the profound difference between coming of age and becoming a man. And by retracing his brother’s footsteps and returning to the site of the Heart Mountain Internment Camp, Ben uncovers a truth that has the power to set him free. An acclaimed memoirist, poet, and playwright, David Mura is one of America’s most insightful cultural critics. His memoirs, Turning Japanese and Where the Body Meets Memory , along with his poems, essays, plays, and performances, have won wide critical praise and numerous awards.

He has learned to live with the violence and chaos that plague his city, and on the night of a deadly bombing in a local restaurant, he works tirelessly to help the shocked and shattered patients brought to the emergency room. But this night of turmoil and death takes a horrifyingly personal turn. His wife's body is found among the dead, with massive injuries, the police coldly announce, typical of those found on the bodies of fundamentalist suicide bombers. As evidence mounts that his wife, Sihem, was responsible for the catastrophic bombing, Dr. Jaafari is torn between cherished memories of their years together and the inescapable realization that the beautiful, intelligent, thoroughly modern woman he loved had a life far removed from the comfortable, assimilated existence they shared.From the graphic, beautifully rendered description of the bombing that opens the novel to the searing conclusion,The Attackportrays the reality of terrorism and its incalculable spiritual costs.

Bachman died in 1985 ("cancer of the pseudonym"), but in late 2006 King found the original typescript of Blaze among his papers at the University of Maine's Fogler Library ("How did this get here?!"), and decided that with a little revision it ought to be published.Blaze is the story of Clayton Blaisdell, Jr. --of the crimes committed against him and the crimes he commits, including his last, the kidnapping of a baby heir worth millions. Blaze has been a slow thinker since childhood, when his father threw him down the stairs--and then threw him down again. After escaping an abusive institution for boys when he was a teenager, Blaze hooks up with George, a seasoned criminal who thinks he has all the answers. But then George is killed, and Blaze, though haunted by his partner, is on his own.He becomes one of the most sympathetic criminals of all of literature.

What they weren’t expecting, though, was the story that emerged in the months that followed—a story as beautiful as it was extraordinary, detailing their little boy’s trip to heaven and back.Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body during the surgery–and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents were doing in another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked of visiting heaven and relayed stories told to him by people he met there whom he had never met in life, sharing events that happened even before he was born. He also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that matched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read.With disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton tells of meeting long-departed family members. He describes Jesus, the angels, how “really, really big” God is, and how much God loves us. Retold by his father, but using Colton’s uniquely simple words, Heaven Is for Real offers a glimpse of the world that awaits us, where as Colton says, “Nobody is old and nobody wears glasses.”Heaven Is for Real will forever change the way you think of eternity, offering the chance to see, and believe, like a child.Show more"	"162"	"January 1, 2010"	"Nonfiction; Christian; Religion; Inspirational; Book Club; Memoir; Spirituality"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780849946158"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7933292-heaven-is-for-real"

As a result, Christianity's most important historical fact—the resurrection—is often the most misunderstood, relegated to Easter and funeral services, creating a powerless Christianity.In Body of Proof, acclaimed apologist and scholar Dr. Jeremiah Johnston sets out to show why Jesus's victory over death is central to a believer's faith. Straightforward, accessible, and practical, this book examines the latest archaeological and textual findings and presents seven tangible, fresh reasons to believe Jesus really rose from the dead—and why it matters today as the foundation of our hope in the face of suffering and grief. When you fully understand the implications of the resurrection, you will begin to understand the power of Christ in you. This changes everything.Show more"	"176"	"March 14, 2023"	"Psychology; Personal Development; Professional Development; Personal Growth; Lifestyle; Education; Nonfiction"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780764230837"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61151402-body-of-proof"

The boys are a tight-knit crew. There’s Kent, one of the most popular kids in school; Ephraim and Max, also well-liked and easygoing; then there’s Newt the nerd and Shelley the odd duck. For the most part, they all get along and are happy to be there – which makes Scoutmaster Tim’s job a little easier. But for some reason, he can’t shake the feeling that something strange is in the air this year. Something wicked . . .It comes to them in the night. An unexpected intruder, stumbling upon their campsite like a wild animal. He is shockingly thin, disturbingly pale, and voraciously hungry – a man in unspeakable torment who exposes Tim and the boys to something far more frightening than any ghost story. Within his body is a bioengineered nightmare, a horror that spreads faster than fear. One by one, the boys will do things no person could ever imagine.And so it begins. An agonizing weekend in the wilderness. A harrowing struggle for survival. No possible escape from the elements, the infected . . . or one another.Part Lord of the Flies, part 28 Days Later – and all-consuming – this tightly written, edge-of-your-seat thriller takes you deep into the heart of darkness, where fear feeds on sanity . . . and terror hungers for more.Show more"	"358"	"February 25, 2014"	"Horror; Fiction; Thriller; Audiobook; Science Fiction; Horror Thriller; Adult"	"Prince Edward Island(Canada)"	"Unknown"	"9781476717715"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17571466-the-troop"

The work considers the relationship between author, text, and reader; concluding that:“The Author is a certain functional principle by which, in our culture, one limits, excludes and chooses: (…) The author is therefore the ideological figure by which one marks the manner in which we fear the proliferation of meaning.”For many, Foucault's lecture mirrors much of Roland Barthes' essayDeath of the Author.Show more"	"15"	"January 1, 1969"	"Philosophy; Nonfiction; Essays; Theory; Literary Criticism; France; French Literature"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18456429-what-is-an-author"
"The Laugh of the Medusa"	"None"	"Hélène Cixous; Keith Cohen; Paula Cohen"	"4.18"	"3,216"	"409"	"Cixous is issuing her female readers an ultimatum of sorts: either they can read it and choose to stay trapped in their own bodies by a language that does not allow them to express themselves, or they can use their bodies as a way to communicate."The Laugh of the Medusa" is an extremely literary essay and well-known as an exhortation to a "feminine mode" of writing; the phrases "white ink" and "écriture féminine" are often cited, referring to this desired new way of writing. It is a strident critique of logocentrism and phallogocentrism, having much in common with Jacques Derrida's earlier thought. The essay also calls for an acknowledgment of universal bisexuality or polymorphous perversity, a precursor of queer theory's later emphases, and swiftly rejects many kinds of essentialism which were still common in Anglo-American feminism at the time. The essay also exemplifies Cixous's style of writing in that it is richly intertextual, making a wide range of literary allusions.(From Wikipedia)Show more"	"20"	"January 1, 1976"	"Feminism; Nonfiction; Essays; Philosophy; Theory; France; Classics"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11080013-the-laugh-of-the-medusa"
"Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power"	"None"	"Audre Lorde"	"4.64"	"1,875"	"202"	""There are many kinds of power, used and unused, acknowledged or otherwise." Thus begins this powerful essay; Uses of the Erotic defines the power of the erotic, names the process by which women have been stripped of this power, and considers how women can reclaim it.Uses of the Erotic shines among Audre Lorde's powerful legacy of speeches and essays, and has influenced feminist thinking for more than 15 years. The false dichotomies that Lorde debunks persist in our cultural imagination: the separation of the erotuc from the spiritual and political. Now, Kore Press brings this essay into stand-alone focus, reprinting it in a fine, handbound pamphlet illustrated with photographs by Tucson photographer Camille Bonzani. Designed by book artist Nancy Solomon, the essay is offset and letterpress printed in an edition of 1000.Show more"	"16"	"January 1, 2000"	"Feminism; Nonfiction; Essays; Queer; Theory; Poetry; Philosophy"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781888553109"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50683.Uses_of_the_Erotic"
"SCUM Manifesto"	"None"	"Valerie Solanas; Avital Ronell"	"3.78"	"11,980"	"2,145"	"SCUM Manifesto was considered one of the most outrageous, violent and certifiably crazy tracts when it first appeared in 1968. Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot Andy Warhol, self-published this work just before her rampage against the king of Pop Art made her a household name and resulted in her confinement to a mental institution. But the Manifesto, for all its vitriol, is impossible to dismiss as just the rantings of a lesbian lunatic. In fact, the work has indisputable prescience, not only as a radical feminist analysis light-years ahead of its timepredicting artificial insemination, ATMs, a feminist uprising against under-representation in the artsbut also as a stunning testament to the rage of an abused and destitute woman.The focus of this edition is not on the nostalgic appeal of the work, but on Avital Ronell’s incisive introduction, “Deviant The Aims of Valerie Solanas.” Here is a reconsideration of Solanas’s infamous text in light of her social milieu, Derrida’s “The Ends of Man” (written in the same year), Judith Butler’s Excitable Speech , Nietzsche’s Ubermensch and notorious feminist icons from Medusa, Medea and Antigone, to Lizzie Borden, Lorenna Bobbit and Aileen Wournos, illuminating the evocative exuberance of Solanas’s dark tract.Show more"	"96"	"May 1, 2004"	"Feminism; Nonfiction; Politics; Philosophy; Essays; Gender; Classics"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781859845530"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52263.SCUM_Manifesto"

She goes on to deftly synthesize the work of Freud, Marx, de Beauvoir, and Engels to create a cogent argument for feminist revolution. Identifying women as a caste, she declares that they must seize the means of reproduction for as long as women (and only women) are required to bear and rear children, they will be singled out as inferior. Ultimately she presents feminism as the key radical ideology, the missing link between Marx and Freud, uniting their visions of the political and the personal.In the wake of recent headlines bemoaning women's squandered fertility and the ongoing debate over the appropriate role of genetics in the future of humanity,The Dialectic of Sexis revealed as remarkably relevant to today's society, a testament to Shulamith Firestone's startlingly prescient vision.Show more"	"240"	"March 5, 2003"	"Feminism; Nonfiction; Philosophy; Politics; Gender; Theory; Gender Studies"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780374527877"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96712.The_Dialectic_of_Sex"

That in the beginning people lived in unrestricted sexual intercourse, which he dubs, not very felicitously, hetaerism.2. That such an intercourse excludes any absolutely certain means of determining parentage; that consequently descent could only be traced by the female line in compliance with maternal law; and that this was universally practiced by all the nations of antiquity.3. That consequently women as mothers, being the only well known parents of younger generations, received a high tribute of respect and deference, amounting to a complete women's rule (gynaicocracy), according to Bachofen's idea.4. That the transition to monogamy, reserving a certain woman exclusively to one man, implied the violation of the primeval religious law (i.e., practically a violation of the customary right of all other men to the same woman), which violation had to be atoned for its permission purchased by the surrender of the women to the public for a limited time.Show more"	"220"	"July 1, 2001"	"Politics; Philosophy; Nonfiction; History; Theory; Sociology; Economics"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780898754698"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52198.The_Origin_of_the_Family_Private_Property_and_the_State"

"Richard II"	"Wars of the Roses"	"William Shakespeare; Roma Gill; Robert          Jackson"	"3.78"	"27,662"	"1,994"	"Written in 1595,Richard IIoccupies a significant place in the Shakespeare canon, marking the transition from the earlier history plays dominated by civil war and stark power to a more nuanced representation of the political conflicts of England's past where character and politics are inextricably intertwined. It is the first of four connected plays--including1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV, andHenry V--generally considered Shakespeare's finest history plays.The drama ofRichard IIcenters on the power struggle between the grandiloquent King Richard and the plain-spoken, blunt Henry Bolingbroke, who is banished from Britain at the beginning of the play. But when Henry's father John of Gaunt dies, Richard confiscates his property with no regard to his son's rights, and Bolingbroke returns to confront the king, who surrenders his crown and is imprisoned in Pomfret Castle, where he is soon murdered. This new edition in the acclaimed Oxford Shakespeare series features a freshly edited version of the text. The wide-ranging introduction describes the play's historical circumstances, both the period that it dramatizes (the start of the "wars of the roses") and the period in which it was written (late Elizabethan England), and the play's political significance in its own time and our own. It also focuses on the play's richly poetic language and its success over the centuries as a play for the stage. Extensive explanatory notes help readers at all levels understand and appreciate the language, characters, and dramatic action and the book's lively illustrations provide a sense of the historical background and performance of the play.Show more"	"168"	"December 18, 2003"	"Plays; Classics; Shakespeare; Drama; Fiction; Historical Fiction; Theatre"	"Unknown"	"Henry Percy "Hotspur",Henry V of England,John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster,Richard II of England,Henry IV of England,Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk,Edward of Langley, 2nd Duke of York,Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey,Sir Henry Greene,Sir Edward Bagot,Sir William Bushy,William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, King of Mann,Eleanor de Bohun, Duchess of Gloucester,Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland,Edward, 2nd Duke of York, Duke of Aumerle,Isabella of Valois,Joan Holland,John Montagu, 3rd Earl of Salisbury,Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley,Sir Stephen Scroop,Thomas Merke, Bishop of Carlisle,William de Colchester, Abbott of Westminster,William de Ros, 6th Baron Ros,William Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby de Eresby,Walter FitzWalter, 4th (or 5th) Baron FitzWalter,Sir Piers Exton,Lord Marshal,Welsh Captain,1st Herald,2nd Herald,Gardener,1st Gardener's Man,2nd Gardener's Man,1st Lady,2nd Lady,Keeper of Pomfret Prison,GroomShow more"	"9780198320043"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82397.Richard_II"

Her father, a famous musician, dies, and she is raised in the Paris Opera House with his dying promise of a protective angel of music to guide her. After a time at the opera house, she begins hearing a voice, who eventually teaches her how to sing beautifully. All goes well until Christine's childhood friend Raoul comes to visit his parents, who are patrons of the opera, and he sees Christine when she begins successfully singing on the stage. The voice, who is the deformed, murderous 'ghost' of the opera house named Erik, however, grows violent in his terrible jealousy, until Christine suddenly disappears. The phantom is in love, but it can only spell disaster.Leroux's work, with characters ranging from the spoiled prima donna Carlotta to the mysterious Persian from Erik's past, has been immortalized by memorable adaptations. Despite this, it remains a remarkable piece of Gothic horror literature in and of itself, deeper and darker than any version that follows.Show more"	"360"	"December 30, 1987"	"Classics; Fiction; Horror; Gothic; Romance; Mystery; Historical Fiction"	"Paris(France),Bretagne(France),France"	"Erik,Christine Daaé,Madame Giry,Raoul de Chagny,La Carlotta,"The Persian",Count Phillippe de Chagny"	"9780060809249"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/480204.The_Phantom_of_the_Opera"

The novel follows Victoria's progress from spoilt daughter of indulgent aristocrats, through a period of abuse and captivity, to a career of deepening criminality conducted under Satan's watchful eye.Charlotte Dacre's narrative deftly displays her heroine's movement from the vitalized position of Ann Radcliffe's heroines to a fully conscious commitment to vice that goes beyond that of 'Monk' Lewis's deluded Ambrosio.The novel's most daring aspect is its anatomy of Victoria's intense sexual attraction to her Moorish servant Zofloya that transgresses taboos both of class and race. A minor scandal on its first publication, and a significant influence on Byron and Shelley, Zofloya has been unduly neglected.

Inside the car sit two-egg twins Rahel and Esthappen, and so begins their tale. . . .Armed only with the invincible innocence of children, they fashion a childhood for themselves in the shade of the wreck that is their family—their lonely, lovely mother, Ammu (who loves by night the man her children love by day), their blind grandmother, Mammachi (who plays Handel on her violin), their beloved uncle Chacko (Rhodes scholar, pickle baron, radical Marxist, bottom-pincher), their enemy, Baby Kochamma (ex-nun and incumbent grandaunt), and the ghost of an imperial entomologist's moth (with unusually dense dorsal tufts).When their English cousin, Sophie Mol, and her mother, Margaret Kochamma, arrive on a Christmas visit, Esthappen and Rahel learn that Things Can Change in a Day. That lives can twist into new, ugly shapes, even cease forever, beside their river "graygreen." With fish in it. With the sky and trees in it. And at night, the broken yellow moon in it.The brilliantly plotted story uncoils with an agonizing sense of foreboding and inevitability. Yet nothing prepares you for what lies at the heart of it.The God of Small Thingstakes on the Big Themes—Love. Madness. Hope. Infinite Joy. Here is a writer who dares to break the rules. To dislocate received rhythms and create the language she requires, a language that is at once classical and unprecedented. Arundhati Roy has given us a book that is anchored to anguish, but fueled by wit and magic.Show more"	"321"	"January 1, 1997"	"Fiction; India; Historical Fiction; Classics; Literary Fiction; Contemporary; Book Club"	"Kerala(India),Aymanam(India),India,South Asia"	"Rahel,Ammu,Mammachi,Chacko,Estha,Velutha,Baby Kochamma"	"9780679457312"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9777.The_God_of_Small_Things"
"The White Tiger"	"None"	"Aravind Adiga"	"3.77"	"201,856"	"13,659"	"Introducing a major literary talent, The White Tiger offers a story of coruscating wit, blistering suspense, and questionable morality, told by the most volatile, captivating, and utterly inimitable narrator that this millennium has yet seen.Balram Halwai is a complicated man. Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life—having nothing but his own wits to help him along.Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village's wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man's (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram's new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of Murder Weekly ("Love -- Rape -- Revenge!"), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive.Balram's eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn't create virtue, and money doesn't solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations.The White Tiger recalls The Death of Vishnu and Bangkok 8 in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own. Amoral, irreverent, deeply endearing, and utterly contemporary, this novel is an international publishing sensation —and a startling, provocative debut.Show more"	"288"	"January 1, 2008"	"Fiction; India; Book Club; Contemporary; Indian Literature; Novels; Literary Fiction"	"Laxmangarh(India),Bihar(India),New Delhi(India),India,Delhi(India),South Asia"	"Balram Halwai,Ashok,Kishan,Kusum,Stork"	"9781416562597"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1768603.The_White_Tiger"

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.Show more"	"1007"	"August 31, 2010"	"Fantasy; Fiction; Epic Fantasy; High Fantasy; Audiobook; Adult; Science Fiction Fantasy"	"Roshar"	"Kaladin Stormblessed,Dalinar Kholin,Shallan Davar,Jasnah Kholin,Adolin Kholin,Hoid,Renarin Kholin,Sylphrena"	"9780765326355"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings"

"Ella Enchanted"	"Ella Enchanted"	"Gail Carson Levine"	"4.02"	"423,214"	"13,440"	"At birth, Ella is inadvertently cursed by an imprudent young fairy named Lucinda, who bestows on her the "gift" of obedience. Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: "Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally." When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescueshim. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor.Show more"	"240"	"September 1, 1998"	"Fantasy; Young Adult; Fiction; Middle Grade; Romance; Childrens; Fairy Tales"	"Unknown"	"Ella Varner,Lucinda,Mandy,Prince Charmont,Areida,Hattie,Olive Abroholos Elephanta"	"9780590920681"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24337.Ella_Enchanted"

After accidentally flinging herself to 1645 England amidst their deadliest witch trials, along with an equally smart-aleck talking cat, people try to help her come home.

One night he buys a journal, its pages blank. The woman who sells him the journal extracts his promise to record his deeds for study. “Lo, the steps of your life mark the journey of your soul.” To expose his prior life, however, would be akin to suicide, for Sheever is a man brimming with secrets.He begins the journal cautiously, describing the area where he works as a cook, and the people he’s forced to endure.

In Knowledge of Life, a book that spans twenty years of his essays and lectures, Canguilhem offers a series of epistemological histories that seek to establish and clarify the stakes, ambiguities, and emergence of philosophical and biological concepts that defined the rise of modern biology.How do transformations in biology and modern medicine shape conceptions of life? How do philosophical concepts feed into biological ideas and experimental practices, and how are they themselves transformed? How does knowledge "undo the experience of life so as to help man remake what life has made without him, in him or outside of him?" Knowledge of Life is Canguilhem's effort to explain how the movements of knowledge and life come to rest upon each other.Published at the dawn of the genetic revolution and still pertinent today, the book tackles the history of cell theory, the conceptual moves toward and away from mechanical understandings of the organism, the persistence of vitalism, and the nature of normality in science and its objects.Show more"	"200"	"December 15, 2008"	"Philosophy; Nonfiction; Science; Biology; Nature"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780823229260"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3323464-knowledge-of-life"

Osamu Dazai’s The Setting Sun takes this milieu as its background to tell the story of the decline of a minor aristocratic family.The story is told through the eyes of Kazuko, the unmarried daughter of a widowed aristocrat. Her search for self meaning in a society devoid of use for her forms the crux of Dazai’s novel. It is a sad story, and structurally is a novel very much within the confines of the Japanese take on the novel in a way reminiscent of authors such as Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata – the social interactions are peripheral and understated, nuances must be drawn, and for readers more used to Western novelistic forms this comes across as being rather wishy-washy.Kazuko’s mother falls ill, and due to their financial circumstances they are forced to take a cottage in the countryside. Her brother, who became addicted to opium during the war is missing. When he returns, Kazuko attempts to form a liaison with the novelist Uehara.

Every corner of the sprawling old house is bursting dysfunctional chaos: Her older sister’s secret love affair. Her brother’s incessant mansplaining. Her sister-in-law’s unapologetic greed. Her younger sister’s obsession with "vibes". Her mother’s penchant for stirring up competition between her children. And all under the stern, watchful gaze of Jack Dean, her father’s enigmatic, unfairly good-looking, second-in-command. It will be a miracle if Alice manages to escape the week unscathed.A story about the transformative power of grief, love, and family, this luscious novel is at once deliciously clever and surprisingly tender, exploring past secrets, present truths, and futures forged in the wake of wild summer storms.Show more"	"384"	"July 8, 2025"	"Romance; Fiction; Audiobook; Contemporary; Summer; Summer Reads; Book Club"	"New England(United States),Wickford, Rhode Island(United States)"	"Alice Storm,Jack Dean,Greta Storm,Sam Storm,Emily Storm,Elisabeth Storm"	"9780593972250"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220239075-these-summer-storms"

Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle—yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.Show more"	"467"	"January 3, 2006"	"Fiction; Magical Realism; Fantasy; Japan; Japanese Literature; Contemporary; Novels"	"Takamatsu(Japan),Japan"	"Kafka Tamura,Sakura,Satoru Nakata,Oshima,Miss Saeki,Hoshino"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4929.Kafka_on_the_Shore"

Her days are spent in a small backyard, dozing off to trashy magazines on a plastic lawn chair.

Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales, a literary genre he so mastered that he himself has become as mythical as the tales he wrote. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories - called eventyrs, or "fantastic tales" - express themes that transcend age and nationality.During his lifetime he was acclaimed for having delighted children worldwide and was feted by royalty. Andersen's fairy tales, which have been translated into more than 125 languages, have become culturally embedded in the West's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature listeners/readers as well.

"The Persians"	"None"	"Aeschylus"	"3.60"	"4,825"	"349"	"The Persians is a Greek tragedy written by Aeschylus in 472 BCE. The play is based on the Persian Wars, specifically the Battle of Salamis in 480 BCE, which was a decisive victory for the Greeks. The play opens with the arrival of a messenger from the Persian court, who brings news of the defeat of the Persian army and the death of King Xerxes' brother. The rest of the play is a series of lamentations and reflections on the tragedy of war, as the Persian court and people come to terms with their loss. The chorus, made up of elderly Persians, serves as a voice of reason and wisdom, urging the characters to accept their fate and learn from their mistakes. The play is notable for its sympathetic portrayal of the Persians, who are typically depicted as barbarians in Greek literature. Aeschylus' portrayal of the Persians as human beings with complex emotions and motivations has been praised for its empathy and insight into the human condition. The Persians is considered one of Aeschylus' greatest works and a masterpiece of Greek tragedy.The mighty Xerxes from Darius sprung, The stream of whose rich blood flows in our veins, Leads against Greece; whether his arrowy shower Shot from the strong-braced bow, or the huge spear High brandish'd, in the deathful field prevails.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations.

In Euripides' Hippolytos , however--informed by the playwright's moral and religious fascination--we find a Phaidra resisting the goddess of love with all her strength, though in the end unsuccessfully. Phaidra becomes a tragic foil for Hippolytos, making his superhuman virtue at once believable and understandable.Robert Bagg's profound translation of this Euripidean masterpiece is idiomatic, natural, and intensely lyrical, designed not only to be read but performed. Unlike most versions, Bagg's Hippolytos sustains the dramatic tome and dynamics to the very end--even after Phaidra's death--and the moving scenes between Hippolytos and Theseus, and later Hippolytos' death-scene with Artemis, receive here unprecedented plausibility and power.Show more"	"128"	"October 29, 1992"	"Classics; Plays; Drama; Fiction; Mythology; Theatre; Tragedy"	"Unknown"	"Artemis (Greek mythology),Theseus (mythology),Hippolytus,Phaedra,Aphrodite (Greek Goddess)"	"9780195072907"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1508.Hippolytos"

The play begins when Odysseus and Neoptolemus, two Greek soldiers, are sent to retrieve Philoctetes and his magical bow, which is needed to win the Trojan War. However, Philoctetes is filled with anger and resentment towards the Greeks who abandoned him, and initially refuses to help them. As the play progresses, the characters grapple with issues of loyalty, betrayal, and the morality of using trickery to achieve a desired outcome. Philoctetes is torn between his desire for revenge and his duty to his fellow Greeks, while Odysseus and Neoptolemus struggle with their own consciences as they try to convince Philoctetes to join their cause.

"Roots: The Saga of an American Family"	"None"	"Alex Haley"	"4.45"	"164,415"	"4,574"	"When he was a boy in Henning, Tennessee, Alex Haley's grandmother used to tell him stories about their family—stories that went back tohergrandparents, andtheirgrandparents, down through the generations all the way to a man she called "the African." She said he had lived across the ocean near what he called the "Kamby Bolongo" and had been out in the forest one day chopping wood to make a drum when he was set upon by four men, beaten, chained and dragged aboard a slave ship bound for Colonial America.Still vividly remembering the stories after he grew up and became a writer, Haley began to search for documentation that might authenticate the narrative. It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of "the African"—Kunta Kinte—but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on theLord Ligonierto Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins. On September 29, 1967, he stood on the dock in Annapolis where his great-great-great-great-grandfather was taken ashore on September 29, 1767. Now he has written the monumental two-century drama of Kunta Kinte and the six generations who came after him—slaves and freedmen, farmers and blacksmiths, lumber mill workers and Pullman porters, lawyers and architects—and one author.But Haley has done more than recapture the history of his own family. As the first black American writer to trace his origins back to their roots, he has told the story of 25,000,000 Americans of African descent. He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities. ButRootsspeaks, finally, not just to blacks, or to whites, but to all people and all races everywhere, for the story it tells is one of the most eloquent testimonials ever written to the indomitability of the human spirit.Show more"	"729"	"October 15, 1980"	"Historical Fiction; Fiction; Classics; Historical; African American; Africa; Race"	"The United States of America,Gambia"	"George Lincoln Rockwell,Alex Haley,Kunta Kinte"	"9780440174646"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/546018.Roots"

This autobiographical account chronicles the remarkable odyssey of Harriet Jacobs (1813–1897) whose dauntless spirit and faith carried her from a life of servitude and degradation in North Carolina to liberty and reunion with her children in the North.Written and published in 1861 after Jacobs' harrowing escape from a vile and predatory master, the memoir delivers a powerful and unflinching portrayal of the abuses and hypocrisy of the master-slave relationship.

"Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster"	"None"	"Jon Krakauer"	"4.26"	"561,879"	"22,885"	"When Jon Krakauer reached the summit of Mt. Everest in the early afternoon of May 10, 1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin his long, dangerous descent from 29,028 feet, twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly toward the top. No one had noticed that the sky had begun to fill with clouds. Six hours later and 3,000 feet lower, in 70-knot winds and blinding snow, Krakauer collapsed in his tent, freezing, hallucinating from exhaustion and hypoxia, but safe. The following morning, he learned that six of his fellow climbers hadn't made it back to their camp and were desperately struggling for their lives. When the storm finally passed, five of them would be dead, and the sixth so horribly frostbitten that his right hand would have to be amputated.Into Thin Airis the definitive account of the deadliest season in the history of Everest by the acclaimed journalist and author of the bestseller Into the Wild. On assignment forOutsideMagazine to report on the growing commercialization of the mountain, Krakauer, an accomplished climber, went to the Himalayas as a client of Rob Hall, the most respected high-altitude guide in the world. A rangy, thirty-five-year-old New Zealander, Hall had summited Everest four times between 1990 and 1995 and had led thirty-nine climbers to the top. Ascending the mountain in close proximity to Hall's team was a guided expedition led by Scott Fischer, a forty-year-old American with legendary strength and drive who had climbed the peak without supplemental oxygen in 1994. But neither Hall nor Fischer survived the rogue storm that struck in May 1996.Krakauer examines what it is about Everest that has compelled so many people -- including himself -- to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense. Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eyewitness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.Show more"	"368"	"October 19, 1999"	"Nonfiction; Memoir; Adventure; Travel; Biography; History; Audiobook"	"Nepal,Mount Everest"	"Rob Hall,Jon Krakauer"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1898.Into_Thin_Air"

Anatoli Boukreev, head climbing guide for the Mountain Madness expedition, stepped into the heart of the storm and brought three of his clients down alive. Here is his amazing story-of an expedition fated for disaster, of the blind ambition that drives people to attempt such dangerous ventures, and of a modern-day hero, who risked his own life to save others..Show more"	"297"	"July 15, 1998"	"Nonfiction; Mountaineering; Adventure; Memoir; Travel; Survival; Climbing"	"Mount Everest"	"Unknown"	"9780312965334"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/925367.The_Climb"

Then a storm exploded on the mountain, ripping the team to shreds, forcing brave men to scratch and crawl for their lives. Rescuers who reached Weathers saw that he was dying, and left him. Twelve hours later, the inexplicable occurred. Weathers appeared, blinded, gloveless, and caked with ice—walking down the mountain. In this powerful memoir, now featuring a new Preface, Weathers describes not only his escape from hypothermia and the murderous storm that killed eight climbers, but the journey of his life. This is the story of a man’s route to a dangerous sport and a fateful expedition, as well as the road of recovery he has traveled since; of survival in the face of certain death, the reclaiming of a family and a life; and of the most extraordinary adventure of finding the courage to say yes when life offers us a second chance.Praise for Left for Dead“Riveting . . .

"Dark Summit: The True Story of Everest's Most Controversial Season"	"None"	"Nick Heil"	"3.94"	"6,239"	"439"	"The inside story of the deadly 2006 climbing season on EverestOn May 15, 2006, a young British climber named David Sharp lay dying near the top of Mount Everest while forty other climbers walked past him on their way to the summit. A week later, Lincoln Hall, a seasoned Australian climber, was left for dead near the same spot. Hall's death was reported around the world, but the next day he was found alive after spending the night on the upper mountain with no food and no shelter.If David Sharp's death was shocking, it was hardly singular: despite unusually good weather, ten others died attempting to reach the summit that year. In this meticulous inquiry into what went wrong, Nick Heil tells the full story of the deadliest year on Everest since the infamous season of 1996. He introduces Russell Brice, the commercial operator who has done more than anyone to provide access to the summit via the mountain's north side—and who some believe was partly accountable for Sharp's death. As more climbers attempt the summit each year, Heil shows how increasingly risky expeditions and unscrupulous outfitters threaten to turn Everest into a deadly circus.Written by an experienced climber and outdoor writer, Dark Summit is both a riveting account of a notorious climbing season and a troubling investigation into whether the pursuit of the ultimate mountaineering prize has spiraled out of control.Show more"	"271"	"April 29, 2008"	"Nonfiction; Mountaineering; Adventure; Survival; History; Climbing; Travel"	"Mount Everest"	"Unknown"	"9780805083101"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2841802-dark-summit"

"K2: Life and Death on the World's Most Dangerous Mountain"	"None"	"Ed Viesturs; David Roberts"	"4.01"	"6,895"	"443"	"A thrilling chronicle of the tragedy-ridden history of climbing K2, the world's most difficult and unpredictable mountain, by the bestselling authors of No Shortcuts to the TopAt 28,251 feet, the world's second-tallest mountain, K2 thrusts skyward out of the Karakoram Range of northern Pakistan. Climbers regard it as the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, with good reason. Four times as deadly as Everest, K2 has claimed the lives of seventy-seven climbers since 1954. In August 2008 eleven climbers died in a single thirty-six-hour period on K2–the worst single-event tragedy in the mountain's history and the second-worst in the long chronicle of mountaineering in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges. Yet summiting K2 remains a cherished goal for climbers from all over the globe. Before he faced the challenge of K2 himself, Ed Viesturs, one of the world's premier high-altitude mountaineers, thought of it as "the holy grail of mountaineering."In Life and Death on the World's Most Dangerous Mountain, Viesturs explores the remarkable history of the mountain and of those who have attempted to conquer it. At the same time he probes K2's most memorable sagas in an attempt to illustrate the lessons learned by confronting the fundamental questions raised by mountaineering–questions of risk, ambition, loyalty to one's teammates, self-sacrifice, and the price of glory. Viesturs knows the mountain firsthand. He and renowned alpinist Scott Fischer climbed it in 1992 and were nearly killed in an avalanche that sent them sliding to almost certain death. Fortunately, Ed managed to get into a self-arrest position with his ice ax and stop both his fall and Scott' s.Focusing on seven of the mountain's most dramatic campaigns, from his own troubled ascent to the 2008 tragedy, Viesturs and Roberts crafts an edge-of-your-seat narrative that climbers and armchair travelers alike will find unforgettably compelling. With photographs from Viesturs's personal collection and from historical sources, this is the definitive account of the world's ultimate mountain, and of the lessons that can be gleaned from struggling toward its elusive summit.Show more"	"342"	"October 13, 2009"	"Nonfiction; Mountaineering; Adventure; Climbing; Travel; History; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780767932509"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6309380-k2"
"The Third Pole: Mystery, Obsession, and Death on Mount Everest"	"None"	"Mark Synnott"	"4.13"	"4,365"	"524"	"***NPR Books We Love selection***“If you’re only going to read one Everest book this decade, make it The Third Pole. . . . A riveting adventure.”— OutsideShivering, exhausted, gasping for oxygen, beyond doubt . . .A hundred-year mystery lured veteran climber Mark Synnott into an unlikely expedition up Mount Everest during the spring 2019 season that came to be known as “the Year Everest Broke.” What he found was a gripping human story of impassioned characters from around the globe and a mountain that will consume your soul—and your life—if you let it.The mystery? On June 8, 1924, George Mallory and Sandy Irvine set out to stand on the roof of the world, where no one had stood before. They were last seen eight hundred feet shy of Everest’s summit still “going strong” for the top. Could they have succeeded decades before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay? Irvine is believed to have carried a Kodak camera with him to record their attempt, but it, along with his body, had never been found. Did the frozen film in that camera have a photograph of Mallory and Irvine on the summit before they disappeared into the clouds, never to be seen again? Kodak says the film might still be viable. . . .Mark Synnott made his own ascent up the infamous North Face along with his friend Renan Ozturk, a filmmaker using drones higher than any had previously flown. Readers witness first-hand how Synnott’s quest led him from oxygen-deprivation training to archives and museums in England, to Kathmandu, the Tibetan high plateau, and up the North Face into a massive storm. The infamous traffic jams of climbers at the very summit immediately resulted in tragic deaths. Sherpas revolted. Chinese officials turned on Synnott’s team. An Indian woman miraculously crawled her way to frostbitten survival. Synnott himself went off the safety rope—one slip and no one would have been able to save him—committed to solving the mystery.Eleven climbers died on Everest that season, all of them mesmerized by an irresistible magic. The Third Pole is a rapidly accelerating ride to the limitless joy and horror of human obsession.Show more"	"448"	"April 13, 2021"	"Nonfiction; History; Adventure; Mountaineering; Travel; Memoir; Sports"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781524745578"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55288158-the-third-pole"

It was the largest earthquake in Nepal in eighty-one years and killed about 8,900 people. That day also became the deadliest in the history of Everest, with eighteen people losing their lives on the mountain.After spending two unsettling days stranded on Everest, Davidson's team was rescued by helicopter. The experience left him shaken, and despite his thirty-three years of climbing and serving as an expedition leader, he wasn't sure that he would ever go back. But in the face of risk and uncertainty, he returned in 2017 and finally achieved his dream of reaching the summit.Suspenseful and engrossing,The Next Everestportrays the experience of living through the biggest disaster to ever hit the mountain. Davidson's background in geology and environmental science makes him uniquely qualified to explain how this natural disaster unfolded and why the seismic threats lurking beneath Nepal are even greater today.

"Huế  1968: A Turning Point of the American War in Vietnam"	"None"	"Mark Bowden"	"4.34"	"7,917"	"824"	"In the early hours of January 31, 1968, the North Vietnamese launched over one hundred attacks across South Vietnam in what would become known as the Tet Offensive. The lynchpin of Tet was the capture of Hue, Vietnam?s intellectual and cultural capital, by 10,000 National Liberation Front troops who descended from hidden camps and surged across the city of 140,000. Within hours the entire city was in their hands save for two small military outposts. American commanders refused to believe the size and scope of the Front?s presence, ordering small companies of marines against thousands of entrenched enemy troops. After several futile and deadly days, Lieutenant Colonel Ernie Cheatham would finally come up with a strategy to retake the city, block by block and building by building, in some of the most intense urban combat since World War II.With unprecedented access to war archives in the U.S. and Vietnam and interviews with participants from both sides, Bowden narrates each stage of this crucial battle through multiple viewpoints. Played out over 24 days and ultimately costing 10,000 lives, the Battle of Hue was by far the bloodiest of the entire war. When it ended, the American debate was never again about winning, only about how to leave. Hue 1968 is a gripping and moving account of this pivotal moment.Show more"	"610"	"June 6, 2017"	"History; Nonfiction; War; Military Fiction; Military History; American History; Politics"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780802127006"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928902-hu-1968"
"Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy, 1945-1975"	"None"	"Max Hastings"	"4.32"	"7,671"	"725"	"An absorbing and definitive modern history of the Vietnam War from the acclaimedNew York Timesbestselling author ofThe Secret War.Vietnam became the Western world’s most divisive modern conflict, precipitating a battlefield humiliation for France in 1954, then a vastly greater one for the United States in 1975. Max Hastings has spent the past three years interviewing scores of participants on both sides, as well as researching a multitude of American and Vietnamese documents and memoirs, to create an epic narrative of an epic struggle. He portrays the set pieces of Dienbienphu, the 1968 Tet offensive, the air blitz of North Vietnam, and also much less familiar miniatures such as the bloodbath at Daido, where a US Marine battalion was almost wiped out, together with extraordinary recollections of Ho Chi Minh’s warriors. Here are the vivid realities of strife amid jungle and paddies that killed two million people.Many writers treat the war as a US tragedy, yet Hastings sees it as overwhelmingly that of the Vietnamese people, of whom forty died for every American. US blunders and atrocities were matched by those committed by their enemies. While all the world has seen the image of a screaming, naked girl seared by napalm, it forgets countless eviscerations, beheadings, and murders carried out by the communists. The people of both former Vietnams paid a bitter price for the Northerners’ victory in privation and oppression. Here is testimony from Vietcong guerrillas, Southern paratroopers, Saigon bargirls, and Hanoi students alongside that of infantrymen from South Dakota, Marines from North Carolina, and Huey pilots from Arkansas.No past volume has blended a political and military narrative of the entire conflict with heart-stopping personal experiences, in the fashion that Max Hastings’ readers know so well. The author suggests that neither side deserved to win this struggle with so many lessons for the twenty-first century about the misuse of military might to confront intractable political and cultural challenges. He marshals testimony from warlords and peasants, statesmen and soldiers, to create an extraordinary record.Show more"	"896"	"October 16, 2018"	"History; Nonfiction; War; Military History; Military Fiction; American History; Politics"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780062405661"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36099654-vietnam"

After the fight, Clarisse admits that, as part of a ritual for the children of Ares, she must bring Ares war chariot back to his temple, the Intrepid. But there is one problem: her immortal brothers, Phobos ( representing fear) and Deimos (representing terror), who are the usual drivers and guardians of the chariot, became jealous and stole it from Clarisse. She knows she will be in trouble if she doesn't get it back by sundown. Percy offers his help, and Clarisse finally accepts it. They meet the two gods at a zoo. They fight them, who turn out to be extremely weak in battle (unlike the nature of Ares) once they discover how to counter the terror or fear, and are easily defeated.

His brain fuzz is lingering, even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight with the pen/sword in his pocket. Somehow Percy manages to make it to a camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he has to keep killing monsters along the way. But the camp doesn't ring any bells with him. The only thing he can recall from his past is another name:Annabeth.HAZEL IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.When she lived before, she didn't do a very good job of it. Sure, she was an obedient daughter, even when her mother was possessed by greed. But that was the problem—when the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her "gift" for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn't say no. Now because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. Hazel wishes she could ride away from it all on the stallion that appears in her dreams.FRANK IS A KLUTZ.His grandmother says he is descended from heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn't see it.

Sie treibt ihn unfreiwillig in die Arme leichtfertiger Hofdamen, zwingt ihn, seinen Kummer im Wein zu ertränken.Die schöne, heimlich begehrte Fürstentochter Schorena, die er in erniedrigender Gefangenschaft hält, erscheint ihm unerreichbarer denn je, da sie ihm nie verzeihen wird, daß er ihren Verlobten töten und ihren Vater blenden ließ.Die glücklichsten Stunden verbringt Giorgi in Gesellschaft treuer Jugendfreunde auf der Jagd. Auf einem seiner Jagdausflüge lernt er den jungen lasischen Baumeister Arssakidse, Schorenas vermeintlichen Milchbruder, kennen.Eine schicksalhafte Laune bestimmt ihn, seinen Oberbaumeister Farsman, den bei Hofe meistgehaßten, doch auch meistgefürchteten Mann, zu entlassen und Arssakidse mit dem Wiederaufbau der Swetizchoweli-Kathedrale zu betrauen.Farsman, wohl wissend, daß keiner außer ihm das Geheimnis kennt, stahlharte Schwerter zu schmieden, deren das königliche Heer so dringend bedarf, spinnt nun mit greisenhafter Rachsucht jenes Netz, das den eifersüchtigen König und den kunstbesessenen jungen Baumeister gleichermaßen ins Verderben stürzen soll.KONSTANTINE GAMSACHURDIA, der viele Jahre in Deutschland lebte, 1919 an der Humboldt-Universität zum Doktor der Philosophie promovierte, Thomas Mann persönlich kannte, mit dem Zaren auf Kriegsfuß stand und sich nach anfänglichen Ressentiments letztlich doch mit der Sowjetmacht versöhnte, begann 1923 zu schreiben.

However, its troubles only served to increase the interest of Daily Telegraph correspondent Tim Butcher, who was sent to cover Africa in 2000. Before long he became obsessed with the idea of recreating Stanley’s original expedition — but travelling alone.Despite warnings Butcher spent years poring over colonial-era maps and wooing rebel leaders before making his will and venturing to the Congo’s eastern border.

"Murder in Buckhead"	"Jack Ludefance"	"Behcet Kaya"	"4.38"	"1,328"	"33"	"Bechet Kaya’s book four in the Jack Ludefance series, Murder in Buckhead, follows PI Jack's all-action mysteries proceedings, resonates with the author's knotty narrative, sparkling characters, and the ever-still place of realism as to the basic human aspirations.Buckhead, a district within Atlanta that boasts many high-end residences and businesses, is the scene of the discovery of a body. As the meticulous detective Shamir Turner assesses the circumstances of the alleged suicide of Casey Ray Olmsted, the son of the influential US Senator Bartholomew Jeremie Olmsted, he is certain of foul play (all shreds of evidence are contrary to the suicide claim). In the wake of Senator Olmsted's request not to proceed with the investigation of his son's death (since it’s a suicide), Turner has no choice but to do nothing (well, just officially...). Meanwhile, in his mid-40s, private investigator Jack Ludefance from Florida receives a phone call from Scarlet Olmsted asking him to look into the ‘real’ deed behind his son Casey's death. Blaire Olmsted, Casey's widower, issues a second exhortation, pleading with Ludefance to probe the senator (her father-in-law) who is after her life.Amidst the seemingly well-heeled proceedings of the murder-mystery investigation, Ludefance makes some unexpected discoveries about the case that goes against his reasoning. Blaire puzzles him with her switch between slyly seductive innuendos and her innocent persona, genuinely concerned about the senator and the threats he makes (a devious diva or an innocent suspect?). Additionally, not only has Blaire become a thorn in the motive of concealing the true story behind Casey's death, but Jack has also become part of the follow-ups and death threats. In a bind, Ludefance must deal with two situations that both get in the way of the corrupt and wicked Senator, who believes in getting rid of any weeds that might stand in the way of his objectives. With Rudy, the young expert hacker, Turner, the ever-ardent detective, and many incidental characters on board, the plot follows Jack’s adventure to unravel the mysterious death of Casey – suicide or murder, or is there an entirely different angle to the case?Through the luxury settings of Atlanta, the criminal underworld, and (not to overlook) the various eateries and human basic appetites for delicacies and meals, the author weaves an interesting tale that goes beyond a mere murder mystery riddle. All of the characters reveal their true selves in their own sexuality, backgrounds, and social positions, whether expressing natural human passion, appetite, or wrestling with their inner conflicts. Despite being a minor force behind the propagation of the murder mystery, the plot's plethora of characters, including Rudy with his subtle fatherly relationship with Jack, Cindy, Jack's sexual interest, as well as Turner and County Sheriff Lawson (aka Hiker), the ideal professionals and boon companions, provide enrichment to the plot with their unique presence and personalities.Show more"	"276"	"July 23, 2022"	"Drama; Book Club; Novels; Contemporary"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61789688-murder-in-buckhead"

"Deception: A Jack Ludefance Novel"	"Jack Ludefance"	"Behcet Kaya"	"4.43"	"1,234"	"94"	"Imagine being hired by someone who says they’re already dead. A Jack Ludefance Novel, by award-winning author Behcet Kaya, is one of those wild and exciting stories which pulls you in from the very first chapter. It’s a crime thriller filled with twists, danger, and a private investigator who has to race against time to uncover the truth before it’s too late. The story starts when a man named Colonel Westerdam visits PI Jack Ludefance unexpectedly claiming that he’s been poisoned and only has a few days to live. He wants Jack to find out who did it - and to dig into some shady activities happening at the Colonel’s hospital. From there, the mystery grows fast. Jack must figure out who would want to kill the Colonel, how it happened, and what secrets the hospital might be hiding, all while time is running out. As the investigation continues, Jack meets a bunch of suspicious characters - from sneaky doctors to a disappearing waiter and a woman in a floppy hat who might know more than she lets on. There’s even a part where Jack must go on a long road trip to find a woman from the Colonel’s past. Bit by bit, Jack feels the pieces of the puzzle coming together but as he goes deeper, the more dangerous things become. The mystery in this story is adequately maintained throughout owing to its clear, fluid, suspenseful, and quick-paced storytelling. The story is built well, with each clue leading to new discoveries that keep you guessing. This book fits in with the crime and mystery genre, with a bit of political drama mixed in. It’s a great pick for teens and all readers who enjoy detective stories and real-life issues. Among its most important lessons are the need to tell the truth, especially when doing so puts one at risk, and the fact that doing the right thing is not always simple but is ultimately worthwhile. The author, Behcet Kaya, has written in a way which feels like a movie playing in your mind. Jack Ludefance is a strong and smart main character, but he also shows a lot of emotion, especially when caring about justice. Additionally, the book will also make you think about truth, lies, and how far someone will go to cover something up. If you like mysteries with a brave detective, secret plots, and a race against time, Deception by Behcet Kaya might just be your next favorite read!Show more"	"301"	"June 27, 2025"	"Drama; Contemporary; Novels; Book Club"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9798289334961"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237445312-deception"
"The Dumb Dumb's Handbook - To Artificial Intelligence: And It's Part in Your Downfall"	"None"	"A.R. Merrydew"	"4.47"	"339"	"2"	"Whilst putting this handbook together, I have tried hard not to embed the narrative with my own thoughts and feelings. Those that I do have, are consolidated here in this forward.It has been difficult not to descend into my own projections where we, the human race will be, moving forward into the future. When we look back in time however, it is easier to understand how we have arrived at this moment in our history.We have over the course of the past eighty years or so, developed a technology, which I firmly believe is about to become our nemesis. For the first time in the history of our species, mankind has created a potential competitor.As a species, we are driven to achieve more, and better ourselves, it is imbedded in our nature. The moment however, will come I am convinced, when we will witness the reward for our exuberance.As this technology grows almost daily, the prospect of AI becoming sentient, will be a moment in time we will come to regret. If this‘race’for AI progress’s to the next level, and we are informed that AI has achieved a singularity, our days I believe will be numbered.Over the past two decades, I have travelled the world working in the construction industry. My role has been that of commissioning those characterless buildings we refer to as Data Centres.I played my part in providing the systems we have all come to take for granted. That being the networks that allows us to post our holiday photos on Facebook, or facilitate a bank transfer from the comfort of our living room.As time has elapsed, and the term Artificial Intelligence has crept more and more into our daily lives, I have come to consider my part in the grand order of things. Frankly, if I knew then, what I know now, I would never have bothered. Someone else could have easily taken my place, and I would have been willing to let them do so.Why you ask, do I now have this change of heart, this epiphany? The reason to me is very clear, and has been for some considerable time. I have been a small cog in a much larger wheel, helping to create a monster that is destroying our world on two fronts.The sheer number of these facilities globally, is helping to destroy our environment. They create global warming, despite attempts to design them to do the opposite. Data Centres consume vast amounts of power and water. They create heat which is dispensed into our already vulnerable climate.Now, this‘Race’as it has been called, is to populate our planet still further with these faceless edifices. This dubious technology, AI, will need more space and somewhere to grow.This Handbook has been produced to enlighten those who have heard the term AI, and know nothing of its origins. There has never been a‘race’until now, and this latest hype is driven I believe by greed, and power hungry nations. Those intent on profit and prestige, with little or no regard as to the consequences of this‘monster’,and all it will deliver.When key figures in the development of AI announce to the world, that our technology will consume us in the next two to three decades, perhaps we should listen. I will leave you to come to your own conclusions, which I am sure you will do so, by the last chapter in this handbook.During my time in the industry, I wrote the first of a series of Sci-fi books, and a story regarding artificial intelligence. The story portrays a world, not too dissimilar to our own, that underwent some significant changes, thanks to AI. The outcome however, was less than favourable.Strangely, as the years have slipped past, the development of AI here on earth, now has that similar uncomfortable feel about it. The irony is, that a distant relation of mine, once wrote a book which also depicted a monster. Her name was Mary Shelley. That story as I recall, did not end well either.A R MerrydewShow more"	"178"	"May 2, 2025"	"Drama; Book Club; Contemporary"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9798282244267"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/232725289-the-dumb-dumb-s-handbook---to-artificial-intelligence"

But, as Rory describes here with a mixture of his trademark openness and humour, what he couldn't have known as a small boy with his heart set on becoming the next James Herriot, was what becoming a vet really entails.In an era when doctors and nurses are talking more openly about the realities of saving human lives, Rory shows what a vital service vets offer in caring for the animals that often form the very heart of the household. He describes the demanding experience of veterinary school, and offers a very human take on what it's like to treat animals, and the little talked about mental health implications that this pressured life or death industry holds. This is a frank and heart-warming account of chasing a childhood dream and learning to love the reality.Show more"	"201"	"August 20, 2020"	"Biography; Animals"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55036181-the-secret-life-of-a-vet"

"The Pythagorean"	"None"	"Alexander Morpheigh"	"4.35"	"411"	"10"	"The protagonist, a young man named Theodore, is about 36 years old and resides in Athens. Following a car accident, he finds himself in the body of a young man from Ancient Greece who attempted suicide. Confused about his whereabouts, Theodore sets out to find people and seeks guidance from the Delphic Oracle – Pythia.Pythia reveals to Theodore that he must meet his true teacher, who alone can return him to his own time. To prepare spiritually for this encounter, Theodore's best bet is one of the greatest teachers of European civilization – Pythagoras, who coincidentally lives during that era. Theo seeks out Pythagoras and becomes his student. Throughout his education, Pythagoras explains to Theodore why he ended up in the past and the significant mission awaiting him in the future. In the process, Pythagoras imparts a wealth of intriguing facts to Theodore, blending authentic Pythagorean teachings with alternative viewpoints from contemporary science.Theodore's beloved Elena remains in Athens, and his lack of attention towards her weighs heavily on him. Through his studies, Theodore learns the practice of lucid dreaming, enabling him to communicate with Elena in his dreams and share his experiences. In a critical turn of events, Theodore steals a bottle of expensive wine, leading to his arrest. Pythagoras intervenes, securing his release on bail. However, Theodore learns he can only remain on the island for a month. With his limited time, he must pass an interview with the local ruler. In another lucid dream, Theodore meets Alkeus, the young man from ancient Greece, who now inhabits his body in the present. Alkeus' adaptability to modern life is hindered by amnesia, and he relies on others to remind him of his past.As Theodore's training progresses, Pythagoras not only introduces alternative, scientifically backed perspectives on the Universe's structure and the existence of parallel worlds but also takes him on journeys to explore them. Theo's situation becomes dire – execution awaits him if he stays in the past, while arrest and imprisonment await him in the future. In a lucid dream, he encounters his future self in a café, realizing that his true teacher is none other than himself. Spiritual purification is the key to his return to the present. Is he prepared to embark on his crucial mission?Show more"	"492"	"July 14, 2024"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9798350954180"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216505858-the-pythagorean"

It’s a seventeen-spot jump – was there a typo? The dorms need to be renovated, their sports teams always come in last place, and let’s just say Tiffin students are known for being more social than academic. On the other hand, the campus is exquisite, class sizes are small, and the dining hall is run by an acclaimed New York chef. And they do have fun—lots of parties and school dances, and a piano man plays in the student lounge every Monday night.But just as the rarefied air of Tiffin is suffused with self-congratulation, the wheels begin to turn – and then they fall off the bus. One by one, scandalous blind items begin to appear on phones across Tiffin’s campus, thanks to a new app called ZipZap, and nobody is safe. From Davi Banerjee, international influencer and resident queen bee, to Simone Bergeron, the new and surprisingly young history teacher, to Charley Hicks, a transfer student who seems determined not to fit in, to Cordelia Spooner, Admissions Director with a somewhat idiosyncratic methodology – everyone has something to hide.As if high school wasn’t dramatic enough...As the year unfolds, bonds are forged and broken, secrets are shared and exposed, and the lives of Tiffin’s students and staff are changed forever.

We wish to be the heirs of all the revolutions of the world, of all the liberation struggles of the peoples of the Third World. We draw the lessons of the American revolution. The French revolution taught us the rights of man. The great October revolution brought victory to the proletariat and made possible the realization of the Paris Commune's dreams of justice."― Thomas Sankara, October 1984 Thomas Sankara led the revolution of 1983 to 1987 in Burkina Faso. In the five speeches contained in this pamphlet, he explains how the peasants and workers of this West African country established a popular revolutionary government and began to fight the hunger, illiteracy and economic backwardness imposed by imperialist domination, and the oppression of women inherited from millennia of class society. In so doing, they have provided an example not only to the workers and small farmers of Africa, but to those of the entire world.

"Invisible Doctrine: The Secret History of Neoliberalism"	"None"	"George Monbiot; Peter Hutchison"	"4.39"	"2,839"	"406"	"A sharp, fiercely argued takedown of neoliberalism that not only defines this slippery concept but connects it to the climate crisis, poverty, and fascism—and shows us how to fight back.Neoliberalism is the dominant ideology of our time. It shapes us in countless ways, yet most of us struggle to articulate what it is. Worse, we have been persuaded to accept this extreme creed as a kind of natural law. In Invisible Doctrine, journalist George Monbiot and filmmaker Peter Hutchison shatter this myth. They show how a fringe philosophy in the 1930s—championing competition as the defining feature of humankind—was systematically hijacked by a group of wealthy elites, determined to guard their fortunes and power. Think tanks, corporations, the media, university departments and politicians were all deployed to promote the idea that people are consumers, rather than citizens.One of the most pernicious effects has been to make our various crises—from climate disasters to economic crashes, from the degradation of public services to rampant child poverty—seem unrelated. In fact, they have all been exacerbated by the “invisible doctrine,” which subordinates democracy to the power of money. Monbiot and Hutchison connect the dots—and trace a direct line from neoliberalism to fascism, which preys on people’s hopelessness and desperation.Speaking out against the fairy tale of capitalism and populist conspiracy theories, Monbiot and Hutchison lay the groundwork for a new politics, one based on truly participatory democracy and “private sufficiency, public luxury”: an inspiring vision that could help bring the neoliberal era to an end.Show more"	"224"	"June 4, 2024"	"Politics; Nonfiction; Economics; History; Philosophy; Audiobook; Sociology"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780593735152"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199393180-invisible-doctrine"

We live in an era marked by war, climate crisis, political polarization, and acute inequality—and yet many of us feel powerless to do anything about these profound issues. We’ve been assured that unfettered capitalism is necessary to ensure our freedom and prosperity, even as we see its corrosive effects proliferating daily. Why, in our age of unchecked corporate power, are most of us living paycheck to paycheck? When the economy falters, why do governments bail out corporations and shareholders but leave everyday people in the dust?Now, economic and political journalist and progressive star on the rise Grace Blakeley exposes the corrupt system that is failing all around us, pulling back the curtain on the free market mythology we have been sold, and showing how, as corporate interests have taken hold, governments have historically been shifting away from competition and democracy and towards monopoly and oligarchy.Tracing over a century of neoliberal planning and backdoor bailouts, Blakeley takes us on a deeply reported tour of the corporate crimes, political maneuvering, and economic manipulation that elites have used to enshrine a global system of “vulture capitalism”—planned capitalist economies that benefit corporations and the uber-wealthy at the expense of the rest of us—at every level, from states to empires. Blakeley exposes the cracks already emerging within capitalism, lighting a path forward for how we can democratize our economy, not just our politics, to ensure true freedom for all.Show more"	"360"	"March 12, 2024"	"Nonfiction; Politics; Economics; History; Audiobook; Sociology; Finance"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781982180850"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176443397-vulture-capitalism"

Our world is defined by inequality, insecurity, lack of community and information overload. As the world burns, mega-corporations are reporting record profits. How are they getting away with it?'Minority rule' is the term Ash Sarkar uses to describe the irrational fear that minorities are trying to overturn and oppress majority populations. In her eye-opening debut, she reveals how minority elites rule majorities by creating the culture wars that have taken over our politics, stoking fear and panic in our media landscape. Because despite what they'll have you believe, anti-racist campaigners aren't actually silencing the 'forgotten' working class, immigrants aren't eating your pets, trans-activists aren't corrupting your children, and cancel culture isn't crushing free speech.InMinority Rule, Sarkar exposes how a strategic misdirection of blame over who is really screwing everything up is keeping the majority divided, while the real ruling minority of hedge fund managers, press barons, landlords and corporations remain on top. And it's facilitating one of the biggest power grabs in history. Most crucially, she shows us how what we really have in common is being concealed by a deafening culture of distraction – and that the first step towards a better future is understanding what is happening now, and how we got here.Show more"	"319"	"February 27, 2025"	"Nonfiction; Politics; Audiobook; Sociology; Society; Social Justice; History"	"United Kingdom"	"Alex Wickham"	"9781526648273"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221564876-minority-rule"

The letters are all addressed to "My dear and unfortunate successor," and they plunge her into a world she never dreamed of, a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an inconceivable evil hidden in the depths of history.The letters provide links to one of the darkest powers that humanity has ever known and to a centuries-long quest to find the source of that darkness and wipe it out. It is a quest for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the legend of Dracula. Generations of historians have risked their reputations, their sanity, and even their lives to learn the truth about Vlad the Impaler and Dracula. Now one young woman must decide whether to take up this quest herself--to follow her father in a hunt that nearly brought him to ruin years ago, when he was a vibrant young scholar and her mother was still alive. What does the legend of Vlad the Impaler have to do with the modern world? Is it possible that the Dracula of myth truly existed and that he has lived on, century after century, pursuing his own unknowable ends? The answers to these questions cross time and borders, as first the father and then the daughter search for clues, from dusty Ivy League libraries to Istanbul, Budapest, and the depths of Eastern Europe. In city after city, in monasteries and archives, in letters and in secret conversations, the horrible truth emerges about Vlad the Impaler's dark reign and about a time-defying pact that may have kept his awful work alive down through the ages.Show more"	"704"	"May 1, 2016"	"Historical Fiction; Fiction; Fantasy; Horror; Vampires; Mystery; Historical"	"Amsterdam(Netherlands, 1974),Budapest(Hungary),Oxford University, Oxford, England,Istanbul(Turkey),England,Netherlands,Hungary,Turkey"	"Bartholomew Rossi,Helen Rossi,Paul Ross,Vlad III,Hugh James,Evá Orbán,Stephen Barley,Anton Stoichev,____ Getzi,Turgut Bora"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30236962-the-historian"

"Underworld"	"None"	"Don DeLillo"	"3.95"	"33,586"	"2,735"	"While Eisenstein documented the forces of totalitarianism and Stalinism upon the faces of the Russian peoples, DeLillo offers a stunning, at times overwhelming, document of the twin forces of the Cold War and American culture, compelling that "swerve from evenness" in which he finds events and people both wondrous and horrifying.Underworldopens with a breathlessly graceful prologue set during the final game of the Giants-Dodgers pennant race in 1951. Written in what DeLillo calls "super-omniscience" the sentences sweep from young Cotter Martin as he jumps the gate to the press box, soars over the radio waves, runs out to the diamond, slides in on a fast ball, pops into the stands where J. Edgar Hoover is sitting with a drunken Jackie Gleason and a splenetic Frank Sinatra, and learns of the Soviet Union's second detonation of a nuclear bomb. It's an absolutely thrilling literary moment. When Bobby Thomson hits Branca's pitch into the outstretched hand of Cotter—the "shot heard around the world"—and Jackie Gleason pukes on Sinatra's shoes, the events of the next few decades are set in motion, all threaded together by the baseball as it passes from hand to hand."It's all falling indelibly into the past," writes DeLillo, a past that he carefully recalls and reconstructs with acute grace. Jump from Giants Stadium to the Nevada desert in 1992, where Nick Shay, who now owns the baseball, reunites with the artist Kara Sax. They had been brief and unlikely lovers 40 years before, and it is largely through the events, spinoffs, and coincidental encounters of their pasts that DeLillo filters the Cold War experience. He believes that "global events may alter how we live in the smallest ways," and as the book steps back in time to 1951, over the following 800-odd pages, we see just how those events alter lives. This reverse narrative allows the author to strip away the detritus of history and pop culture until we get to the story's pure elements: the bomb, the baseball, and the Bronx. In an epilogue as breathless and stunning as the prologue, DeLillo fast-forwards to a near future in which ruthless capitalism, the Internet, and a new, hushed faith have replaced the Cold War's blend of dread and euphoria.Through fragments and interlaced stories—including those of highway killers, artists, celebrities, conspiracists, gangsters, nuns, and sundry others—DeLillo creates a fragile web of connected experience, a communal Zeitgeist that encompasses the messy whole of five decades of American life, wonderfully distilled.Show more"	"827"	"January 1, 1999"	"Fiction; Novels; Literature; Literary Fiction; Classics; American; Historical Fiction"	"New Jersey(United States),Nevada(United States)"	"Brian Glassic,Nick Shay,Klara Sax,Mario Badalato,Lenny Bruce,George Manza,Cotter Martin"	"9780330369954"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11761.Underworld"

Unsettled and unsupported, her life in this new place is illuminated by the passionate romances of the present but haunted by society’s expectations and her ancestral past.Translated into sensuous English for the first time by Lucy Scott, Astrid Roemer’s intimate novel—with its tales of plantation-dwelling snakes, rare orchids, and star-crossed lovers—is a blistering meditation on the cruelties we inflict on those who disobey.

Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain. Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter's story and her own, Margaret takes on the commission.As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good, Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family, including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire.Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida's storytelling but remains suspicious of the author's sincerity. She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves.The Thirteenth Tale is a love letter to reading, a book for the feral reader in all of us, a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children.

Feeling helpless and frustrated, his youngest daughter, Agnes, applies for a job as a governess to the children of a wealthy, upper-class, English family.Ecstatic at the thought that she has finally gained control and freedom over her own life, Agnes arrives at the Bloomfield mansion armed with confidence and purpose. The cruelty with which the family treat her however, slowly but surely strips the heroine of all dignity and belief in humanity.A tale of female bravery in the face of isolation and subjugation, Agnes Grey is a masterpiece claimed by Irish writer, George Moore, to be possessed of all the qualities and style of a Jane Austen title. Its simple prosaic style propels the narrative forward in a gentle yet rhythmic manner which continuously leaves the listener wanting to know more.Anne Brontë, the somewhat lesser known sister, was in fact the first to finish and publish Agnes Grey under the pseudonym of Acton Bell. Charlotte and Emily followed shortly after with Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights.As Anne passed away from what is now known to be pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of just 29, she only published one further title; The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.

Thoreau lived alone in a secluded cabin at Walden Pond. It is one of the most influential and compelling books in American literature. This new paperback edition-introduced by noted American writer John Updike-celebrates the 150th anniversary of this classic work. Much of Walden's material is derived from Thoreau's journals and contains such engaging pieces as "Reading" and "The Pond in the Winter" Other famous sections involve Thoreau's visits with a Canadian woodcutter and with an Irish family, a trip to Concord, and a description of his bean field. This is the complete and authoritative text of Walden-as close to Thoreau's original intention as all available evidence allows. For the student and for the general reader, this is the ideal presentation of Thoreau's great document of social criticism and dissent.Show more"	"352"	"April 18, 2004"	"Classics; Philosophy; Nonfiction; Nature; Memoir; Literature; Biography"	"The United States of America,Concord, Massachusetts(United States, 1845)"	"Henry David Thoreau"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16902.Walden_or_Life_in_the_Woods"

"Emerson, the Stoics, and Me: Timeless Wisdom for Living an Authentic Life"	"None"	"Mark Matousek"	"3.92"	"543"	"47"	""This is a beautiful book, full of ideas that could help restore America’s genius for freedom and promise.”—Thomas Moore,New York Timesbestselling author ofCare of the SoulA lifelong Emerson lover, teacher, and spiritual seeker reveals how American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson’s twelve essential teachings hold the answer to living an authentic and fulfilling life, one that is in harmony with our souls.In this wise, illuminating book, award-winning author Mark Matousek reveals how Emerson’s timeless wisdom can help us with the problems we’re facing today. America’s ‘original Stoic’ confronted many of the issues before us, from polarization to fake news, from crooked politicians and rampant materialism, to the scourge of racism.Matousek explains that Emerson’s path of self-reliance can radically improve your quality of life. The mentor and friend of Henry David Thoreau, Emerson (aka the Oracle of Concord) was America’s first self-help author, and his nation’s conscience for half a century. Like the Stoics before him, he emphasized self-knowledge and mindfulness as paths to happiness; also, self-reliance, cooperation, non-conformity, originality, adaptability, and receptiveness.As Americans are once again discovering the power of Stoicism, Matousek shows why Emerson’s vision is precisely the medicine we need today. The principles of Waldo’s philosophy are universal and require no spiritual faith to put into practice.Each person creates her own realityObstacles are teachers in disguiseYour character is your destinyWonder and awe are the keys to the kingdomNonconformity is the greatest virtueNature is the doorway to GodLife without self-knowledge is not worth livingEmerson encourages us to throw-off conventions and platitudes, explore ourselves in depth, tell the truth about what we find there, and awaken to our greatest potential.Show more"	"288"	"June 13, 2023"	"Philosophy; Nonfiction; Self Help; Lifestyle; Personal Development; Education; Productivity"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780063059719"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61713837-emerson-the-stoics-and-me"

Maus approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in “drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust” (The New York Times).Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek’s harrowing story of survival is woven into the author’s account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century’s grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. Maus studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.Show more"	"296"	"October 2, 2003"	"Graphic Novels; Comics; Nonfiction; History; Memoir; Biography; Historical"	"Auschwitz(Poland),Poland,Sosnowiec(Poland)"	"Vladek Spiegelman,Anja Spiegelman,Art Spiegelman,Mala Spiegelman"	"9780141014081"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15195.The_Complete_Maus"

This novella became the movie Stand By Me.Finally, a disgraced woman is determined to triumph over death in “The Breathing Method.”“The wondrous readability of his work, as well as the instant sense of communication with his characters, are what make Stephen King the consummate storyteller that he is,” hailed the Houston Chronicle about Different Seasons.Show more"	"560"	"February 16, 1995"	"Horror; Fiction; Short Stories; Thriller; Mystery; Fantasy; Drama"	"Shawshank State Penitentiary(United States, 1948),Los Angeles, California(United States, 1974),Castle Rock, Maine(United States, 1960)"	"Andy Dufresne,Ellis Boyd Redding,Todd Bowden,Kurt Dussander,Gordie Lachance,Chris Chambers"	"9780751514629"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39662.Different_Seasons"

Through those letters, she enrolls in a kind of correspondence course, covering Socrates to Sartre, with a mysterious philosopher, while receiving letters addressed to another girl. Who is Hilde? And why does her mail keep turning up? To unravel this riddle, Sophie must use the philosophy she is learning—but the truth turns out to be far more complicated than she could have imagined.Show more"	"403"	"January 1, 1995"	"Philosophy; Fiction; Classics; Young Adult; Fantasy; Novels; Literature"	"Norway(, 1990)"	"Charles Darwin,Cecilia Skotbu,Malaikat Ariel,Plato,Aristotle (philosopher),Thomas Aquinas,René Descartes,George Berkeley,John Locke,David Hume,St. Augustine,Baruch Spinoza,Sofie Amundsen,Jorunn,Jesus,Immanuel Kant,Socrates (philosopher),Sigmund Freud,Karl Marx"	"9781857993288"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10959.Sophie_s_World"

Hence: Can Machiavelli, who makes the following observations, be Machiavellian as we understand the disparaging term?1. So it is that to know the nature of a people, one need be a Prince; to know the nature of a Prince, one need to be of the people.2. If a Prince is not given to vices that make him hated, it is unsusal for his subjects to show their affection for him.3. Opportunity made Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and others; their virtue domi-nated the opportunity, making their homelands noble and happy. Armed prophets win; the disarmed lose.4. Without faith and religion, man achieves power but not glory.5. Prominent citizens want to command and oppress; the populace only wants to be free of oppression.6. A Prince needs a friendly populace; otherwise in diversity there is no hope.7. A Prince, who rules as a man of valor, avoids disasters,8. Nations based on mercenary forces will never be solid or secure.9. Mercenaries are dangerous because of their cowardice10. There are two ways to fight: one with laws, the other with force.

"Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World"	"None"	"Cal Newport"	"4.16"	"186,195"	"14,408"	"One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.InDeep Work, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four "rules," for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice,Deep Worktakes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored.Deep Workis an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.Show more"	"296"	"January 5, 2016"	"Nonfiction; Self Help; Productivity; Business; Psychology; Personal Development; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781455586691"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work"

The winner carries light and life to all the temples of Reino del Sol, but the loser has the greatest honor of all―they will be sacrificed to Sol, their body used to fuel the Sun Stones that will protect the people of Reino del Sol for the next ten years.Teo, a 17-year-old Jade semidiós and the trans son of Quetzal, goddess of birds, has never worried about the Trials…or rather, he’s only worried for others. His best friend Niya―daughter of Tierra, the god of earth―is one of the strongest heroes of their generation and is much too likely to be chosen this year. He also can’t help but worry (reluctantly, and under protest) for Aurelio, a powerful Gold semidiós and Teo’s friend-turned-rival who is a shoo-in for the Trials. Teo wouldn’t mind taking Aurelio down a notch or two, but a one-in-ten chance of death is a bit too close for Teo’s taste.But then, for the first time in over a century, Sol chooses a semidiós who isn’t a Gold. In fact, he chooses two: Xio, the 13-year-old child of Mala Suerte, god of bad luck, and…Teo. Now they must compete in five mysterious trials, against opponents who are both more powerful and better trained, for fame, glory, and their own survival.Show more"	"352"	"September 6, 2022"	"Fantasy; Young Adult; LGBT; Queer; Mythology; Fiction; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55878999-the-sunbearer-trials"

Audiences accustomed to the pieties of late Victorian romantic fiction were taken aback by Chopin's daring portrayal of a woman trapped in a stifling marriage, who seeks and finds passionate physical love outside the confines of her domestic situation.Aside from its unusually frank treatment of a then-controversial subject, the novel is widely admired today for its literary qualities. Edmund Wilson characterized it as a work "quite uninhibited and beautifully written, which anticipates D. H. Lawrence in its treatment of infidelity." Although the theme of marital infidelity no longer shocks, few novels have plumbed the psychology of a woman involved in an illicit relationship with the perception, artistry, and honesty that Kate Chopin brought toThe Awakening.Show more"	"195"	"January 1, 2006"	"Classics; Fiction; Feminism; School; Literature; Historical Fiction; Read For School"	"New Orleans, Louisiana(United States),Grand Isle, Louisiana(United States)"	"Edna Pontellier,Léonce Pontellier,Robert Lebrun,Alcée Arobin,Adèle Ratignolle,Mademoiselle Reisz"	"9780543898081"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58345.The_Awakening"

The protagonist of Booth Tarkington's great historical drama is George Amberson Minafer, the spoiled and arrogant grandson of the founder of the family's magnificence. Eclipsed by a new breed of developers, financiers, and manufacturers, this pampered scion begins his gradual descent from the midwestern aristocracy to the working class. TodayThe Magnificent Ambersonsis best known through the 1942 Orson Welles movie, but as the critic Stanley Kauffmann noted, "It is high time that [the novel] appear again, to stand outside the force of Welles's genius, confident in its own right." "The Magnificent Ambersonsis perhaps Tarkington's best novel," judged Van Wyck Brooks. "[It is] a typical story of an American family and town--the great family that locally ruled the roost and vanished virtually in a day as the town spread and darkened into a city. This novel no doubt was a permanent page in the social history of the United States, so admirably conceived and written was the tale of the Amber-sons, their house, their fate and the growth of the community in which they were submerged in the end."Booth Tarkington (1869-1946), a prolific writer who achieved overnight success with his first novel,The Gentleman from Indiana(1899), is perhaps best remembered as the author of the popular Penrod adventures andSeventeen(1916).

As the oldest of seven children who were dragged from military base to military base across the South, Pat bore witness to the toll his father's behavior took on his siblings, and especially on his mother, Peg. She was Pat's lifeline to a better world-that of books and culture. But eventually, despite repeated confrontations with his father, Pat managed to claw his way toward a life he could have only imagined as a child.Pat's great success as a writer has always been intimately linked with the exploration of his family history. While the publication of The Great Santini brought Pat much acclaim, the rift it caused with his father brought even more attention. Their long-simmering conflict burst into the open, fracturing an already battered family. But as Pat tenderly chronicles here, even the oldest of wounds can heal. In the final years of Don Conroy's life, he and his son reached a rapprochement of sorts. Quite unexpectedly, the Santini who had freely doled out physical abuse to his wife and children refocused his ire on those who had turned on Pat over the years. He defended his son's honor.The Death of Santini is at once a heart-wrenching account of personal and family struggle and a poignant lesson in how the ties of blood can both strangle and offer succor. It is an act of reckoning, an exorcism of demons, but one whose ultimate conclusion is that love can soften even the meanest of men, lending significance to one of the most-often quoted lines from Pat's bestselling novel The Prince of Tides: "In families there are no crimes beyond forgiveness."Show more"	"352"	"October 29, 2013"	"Nonfiction; Memoir; Biography; Biography Memoir; Book Club; Southern; Autobiography"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780385530903"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17857644-the-death-of-santini"

"New Startup Mindset: Ten Mindset Shifts to Build the Company of Your Dreams"	"None"	"Sandra Shpilberg; Cassandra Parker"	"4.28"	"425"	"25"	"Sandra Shpilberg will show you a new way to succeed as an entrepreneur! This provocative startup tale of success exposes Silicon Valley’s startup myths and sets forth a new approach for aspiring and current founders to build companies that make an impact.In New Startup Mindset, Sandra Shpilberg, founder and CEO of Seeker Health, introduces a new mindset for starting and building a successful company. Shpilberg shows that Silicon Valley’s startup formula—a few young male cofounders attempting to build a unicorn funded by venture capital—is a broken system that puts excessive emphasis on hype and improbable outsized outcomes, disregards real results such as revenue and profit, and promotes limiting beliefs for the next generation of entrepreneurs.In 2015, Shpilberg founded Seeker Health, a digital patient-finding platform. The company grew rapidly to serve over sixty biotechnology companies, connect millions of patients with serious diseases to clinical trials, and achieve great financial success. From the start, Shpilberg did almost everything differently than the blazed path: she chose to be a solo founder, didn’t pursue an incubator, didn’t accept outside funding, led development of software despite not being a programmer, and charged customers from month one. Instead of creating hype about fundraising based on fictitious valuations, Shpilberg focused on customer needs, yielding a startup with revenue, profit, and impact; and in September 2018, a large life science services company acquired her startup while she was still the sole owner.In New Startup Mindset, Shpilberg shares her success story of starting, building, and exiting her startup and provides readers with sage insights and practical tools to follow this approach. This book is simultaneously a needed dose of reality for Silicon Valley and a large serving of inspiration for those who want to create something from nothing. It is a must-read for aspiring startup founders and current entrepreneurs, especially those who may think they don’t fit the mold of a Silicon Valley founder and are open to a new way of making a definitive and profound impact with the companies they create.Show more"	"216"	"April 15, 2020"	"Business; Self Help; Nonfiction; Education; Productivity; How To; Philosophy"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781734610598"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53297993-new-startup-mindset"
"Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges"	"None"	"Amy Cuddy"	"3.90"	"19,005"	"1,439"	"MORE THAN HALF A MILLION COPIES  Learn the simple techniques you'll need to approach your biggest challenges with confidence.Have you ever left a nerve-racking challenge and immediately wished for a do over? Maybe after a job interview, a performance, or a difficult conversation? The very moments that require us to be genuine and commanding can instead cause us to feel phony and powerless. Too often we approach our lives' biggest hurdles with dread, execute them with anxiety, and leave them with regret.By accessing our personal power, we can achieve "presence," the state in which we stop worrying about the impression we're making on others and instead adjust the impression we've been making on ourselves. As Harvard professor Amy Cuddy's revolutionary book reveals, we don't need to embark on a grand spiritual quest or complete an inner transformation to harness the power of presence. Instead, we need to nudge ourselves, moment by moment, by tweaking our body language, behavior, and mind-set in our day-to-day lives.Amy Cuddy has galvanized tens of millions of viewers around the world with her TED talk about "power poses." Now she presents the enthralling science underlying these and many other fascinating body-mind effects, and teaches us how to use simple techniques to liberate ourselves from fear in high-pressure moments, perform at our best, and connect with and empower others to do the same.Brilliantly researched, impassioned, and accessible, Presence is filled with stories of individuals who learned how to flourish during the stressful moments that once terrified them. Every reader will learn how to approach their biggest challenges with confidence instead of dread, and to leave them with satisfaction instead of regret." Presence feels at once concrete and inspiring, simple but ambitious — above all, truly powerful." — New York Times Book ReviewShow more"	"352"	"December 22, 2015"	"Nonfiction; Self Help; Psychology; Business; Personal Development; Leadership; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780316256575"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25066556-presence"

Stuart Little, the hero, is a mouse in the family of Frederick C. Little and is a debonair little character with a shy, engaging manner and a somewhat philosophical turn of mind. He is a great help around the house, and everybody except Snowbell the cat likes him a great deal. In spite of his small size, Stuart gets around in the world, riding a Fifth Avenue bus, racing (and winning in) a sailboat in Central Park, teaching school for a day, and so on. His size -- just over two inches -- does give him some trouble now and then, like the time he was rolled up in the window shade, or when he got dumped into a garbage scow. But on the whole his life is a happy one. His great adventure comes when, at the age of seven, he sets out in the world to seek his dearest friend, Margalo, a beautiful little bird who stayed for a few days in the Littles' Boston fern. It is on this search that we leave Stuart, going north in his little car, sure he is heading in the right direction. In this special gift-book edition of a beloved classic, renowned artist Rosemary Wells has lovingly added delicate watercolor to the original black-and-white drawings by Garth Williams. Stuart Little, small in size only, has the indomitable spirit of a heroic figure, and his story, funny and tender and exciting by turns, will be read, reread, and loved by young and old.Show more"	"Hardcover"	"October 26, 2004"	"Classics; Childrens; Fiction; Fantasy; Animals; Chapter Books; Friendship"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780060739409"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33530.Charlotte_s_Web_Stuart_Little_Slipcase_Gift_Set"

D. Salinger’s fictional Glass family.Franny Glass is a pretty, effervescent college student on a date with her intellectually confident boyfriend, Lane. They appear to be the perfect couple, but as they struggle to communicate with each other about the things they really care about, slowly their true feelings come to the surface. The second story in this book, ‘Zooey’, plunges us into the world of her ethereal, sophisticated family. When Franny’s emotional and spiritual doubts reach new heights, her older brother Zooey, a misanthropic former child genius, offers her consolation and brotherly advice.Written in Salinger’s typically irreverent style, these two stories offer a touching snapshot of the distraught mindset of early adulthood and are full of the insightful emotional observations and witty turns of phrase that have helped make Salinger’s reputation what it is today.Show more"	"201"	"January 30, 2001"	"Classics; Fiction; Short Stories; Literature; American; Novels; Literary Fiction"	"Unknown"	"Franny Glass,Zooey Glass,Buddy Glass,Lane Coutell,Bessie Glass"	"9780316769020"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5113.Franny_and_Zooey"

"The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory"	"None"	"Brian Greene"	"4.10"	"101,873"	"2,419"	"Brian Greene, one of the world's leading string theorists, peels away the layers of mystery surrounding string theory to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions, where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter, from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas, is generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy.Today, physicists and mathematicians throughout the world are feverishly working on one of the most ambitious theories ever proposed: superstring theory. String theory, as it is often called, is the key to the Unified Field Theory that eluded Einstein for more than thirty years. Finally, the century-old antagonism between the large and the small--General Relativity and Quantum Theory--is resolved. String theory proclaims that all of the wondrous happenings in the universe, from the frantic dancing of subatomic quarks to the majestic swirling of heavenly galaxies, are reflections of one grand physical principle and manifestations of one single entity: microscopically tiny vibrating loops of energy, a billionth of a billionth the size of an atom. In this brilliantly articulated and refreshingly clear book, Greene relates the scientific story and the human struggle behind twentieth-century physics' search for a theory of everything.Through the masterful use of metaphor and analogy,The Elegant Universemakes some of the most sophisticated concepts ever contemplated viscerally accessible and thoroughly entertaining, bringing us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works.Show more"	"464"	"October 11, 2010"	"Science; Nonfiction; Physics; Astronomy; Popular Science; Space; Philosophy"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780393338102"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8049273-the-elegant-universe"

Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation?The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet—if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity.InThe Grand Designthey explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking andMlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything.” If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems,The Grand Designis a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other.'Show more"	"199"	"September 7, 2010"	"Science; Nonfiction; Physics; Philosophy; Astronomy; Popular Science; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780553805376"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520362-the-grand-design"

Even Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould, while extolling the beauty of evolution and examining case studies, have not focused on the evidence itself. Yet the proof is vast, varied, and magnificent, drawn from many different fields of science. Scientists are observing species splitting into two and are finding more and more fossils capturing change in the past—dinosaurs that have sprouted feathers, fish that have grown limbs.Why Evolution Is Trueweaves together the many threads of modern work in genetics, paleontology, geology, molecular biology, and anatomy that demonstrate the "indelible stamp" of the processes first proposed by Darwin.

Are there gateways to parallel universes? What happened before the first day of Creation? These types of questions are at the center of current scientific activity. Indeed, many physicists today believe that there are other dimensions beyond the four of our space-time, and that a unified vision of the various forces of nature can be achieved, if we consider that everything we see around us, from the trees to the stars are nothing but vibrations in hyperspace. Hyperspace theory - and its more recent derivation, superstring theory - is the eye of this revolution. In this book, Michio Kaku shows us a fascinating panorama, which completely changes our view of the cosmos, and takes us on a dazzling journey through new dimensions: wormholes connecting parallel universes, time machines, "baby universes" and more. Similar wonders are emerging in some pages in which everything is explained with elegant simplicity and where the mathematical formulation is replaced by imaginative illustrations that allow the problems to be visualized.

"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking"	"None"	"Malcolm Gladwell; Barry Fox; Irina Henegar"	"3.96"	"619,442"	"19,837"	"Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that madeThe Tipping Pointa classic,Blinkchanges the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?InBlinkwe meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.Show more"	"296"	"April 3, 2007"	"Nonfiction; Psychology; Business; Self Help; Science; Audiobook; Sociology"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780316010665"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink"
"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything"	"Freakonomics"	"Steven D. Levitt; Stephen J. Dubner"	"4.01"	"893,036"	"20,421"	"Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap)Show more"	"268"	"October 17, 2006"	"Nonfiction; Economics; Business; Science; Psychology; Sociology; Finance"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780061234002"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202.Freakonomics"

Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is thene plus ultraof all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery.

"The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company"	"None"	"Robert Iger; Joel Lovell"	"4.40"	"95,169"	"6,890"	"A grand vision defined: The CEO of The Walt Disney Company shares the ideas and values he has used to reinvent one of the most beloved companies in the world, and inspire the people who bring the magic to life.In 2005, Robert Iger became CEO of The Walt Disney Company during a difficult time. Morale had deteriorated, competition was more intense, and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company's history. "I knew there was nothing to be gained from arguing over the past," Iger writes. "The only thing that mattered was the future, and I believed I had a clear idea of the direction Disney needed to go." It came down to three clear ideas: 1) Create the highest quality content Disney could produce. 2) Embrace and adopt technology instead of fighting it. And 3) Think bigger--think global--and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets.Twelve years later, Disney is the largest, most respected media company in the world counting Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over, and Iger is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our time.Now, he's sharing the lessons he's learned while running Disney and leading its 200,000 employees--taking big risks in the face of historic disruption; learning to inspire the people who work for you; leading with fairness and communicating principles clearly. This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years, since the day he started as a studio supervisor at ABC. It's also about thoughtfulness and respect, and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues, from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the evolvingStar Warsmyth."Over the past fourteen years, I think I've learned so much about what real leadership is," Iger writes. "But I couldn't have articulated all of this until I lived it. You can't fake it--and that's one of the key lessons in this book."Librarian Note:This is an Advance Reader Copy issued with ISBN 9780399592096.

"Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration"	"None"	"Ed Catmull; Amy    Wallace"	"4.21"	"101,872"	"6,077"	"“What does it mean to manage well?”From Ed Catmull, co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios, comes an incisive book about creativity in business—sure to appeal to readers of Daniel Pink, Tom Peters, and Chip and Dan Heath.Creativity, Inc.is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as theToy Storytrilogy,Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up,andWALL-E,which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity reallyis. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later,Toy Storywas released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:• Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.• If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.• It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them.• The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them.• A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.• Do not assume that general agreement will lead to change—it takes substantial energy to move a group, even when all are on board.Show more"	"368"	"April 8, 2014"	"Business; Nonfiction; Leadership; Biography; Management; Audiobook; Self Help"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780812993011"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc"
"Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies"	"None"	"Jim Collins; Jerry I. Porras"	"4.06"	"84,146"	"1,029"	""This is not a book about charismatic visionary leaders. It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about visionary companies." So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time. Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: "What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?" What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter & Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked? By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies. Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.Show more"	"368"	"November 1, 2004"	"Business; Nonfiction; Leadership; Management; Entrepreneurship; Buisness; Self Help"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780060566104"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4122.Built_to_Last"
"Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant"	"None"	"W. Chan Kim; Renée Mauborgne"	"4.01"	"86,849"	"1,930"	"A global phenomenon now published in a record 43 languages. Over 3.5 million copies sold. A bestseller across five continents.Since the dawn of the industrial age, companies have engaged in head-to-head competition in search of sustained, profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as widely practiced as this approach has been, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne’s research shows that is not the way to create profitable growth in the future.In their book Blue Ocean Strategy—now expanded and with a new Preface by the authors—Kim and Mauborgne (INSEAD) argue that cutthroat competition increasingly results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating "blue oceans"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade. Blue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company, organization or government can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future.Learn more at blueoceanstrategy.com.

As a human struggling to survive in a city that caters to the needs of vampires, werewolves, witches, and other supernatural creatures, she always assumed her life would remain simple, predictable, and as safe as her world would allow.Until she barely escapes abduction at the hands of Darkslayers—supernatural bounty hunters that possess the Sight, a magical tracking ability that allows them to see a person’s aura—and one of her friends is taken in her place. The abductors are demanding a ransom: Loren's life in exchange for her friend's safe return. Loren will do whatever it takes to get her friend back—even if it means accepting help from Darien Cassel, the leader of the Seven Devils, the most feared Darkslaying circle in the city.Darien specializes in tracking down demons and criminals that are better off dead than alive, so when he takes a job to track down Loren and finds out she is human—and couldn't hurt a fly if her life depended on it—he decides to protect her instead of turn her in for a reward. As much as Loren doesn't want to admit it, Darien is her best and only chance at finding her friend alive, if she can somehow manage to get along with him—and not fall head-over-heels in love with him in the process, which is far easier said than done.When more women start disappearing, and some of them slowly turn up dead, Loren and Darien's search for answers takes them deep into Angelthene's corrupt underbelly, where they discover a dark secret that threatens to unravel their world. And when tragedy strikes, Loren learns that love can make an ordinary person do extraordinary things.From the author of Dreams of Ice and Iron comes a new fantasy romance perfect for fans of Sarah J Maas, Ilona Andrews, and Cassandra Clare.Please note: This book contains darker content that might be triggering for some readers, including violence, mature language, sexual content, drug abuse, death of an animal (with a HEA), sexual harassment, anxiety, panic attacks, depression, and suicide.

He receives an essay from one of the students—a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night 50 years ago when Harry Dunning’s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.Not much later, Jake’s friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958. He enlists Jake on an insane—and insanely possible—mission to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of Jake’s life—a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.A tribute to a simpler era and a devastating exercise in escalating suspense, 11/22/63 is Stephen King at his epic best.Show more"	"849"	"November 8, 2011"	"Fiction; Historical Fiction; Science Fiction; Time Travel; Horror; Fantasy; Thriller"	"Maine(United States, 2011),Derry, Maine(United States, 1958),Jodie, Texas(United States)"	"Lee Harvey Oswald,Jake Epping,Al Templeton,Harry Dunning,Marina Oswald Porter,Bill Titus,Sadie Dunhill,Yellow Card Man,Deacon "Deke" Simmons,Ellen Dockerty,George de Mohrenschildt,Richie Tozier,Beverly Marsh,John F.

He had to learn how to play his mother's games in order to survive because she no longer considered him a son, but a slave; and no longer a boy, but an "it." Dave's bed was an old army cot in the basement, and his clothes were torn and raunchy. When his mother allowed him the luxury of food, it was nothing more than spoiled scraps that even the dogs refused to eat. The outside world knew nothing of his living nightmare.

"A Man Named Dave"	"Dave Pelzer"	"Dave Pelzer"	"3.93"	"35,218"	"1,316"	"More About DaveA Man Named Daveis the conclusion to a trio of autobiographical books by Dave Pelzer, who to millions of readers ofA Child Called "It"andThe Lost Boyhas become an inspirational figure.A Child Called "It"is the gripping and harrowing account of Pelzer's abuse at the hands of his mother, beginning when he was four years old and continuing until teachers and neighbors were finally able to intervene and he was placed in foster care at age 12.The Lost Boypicks up whereA Child Called "It"leaves off and details Pelzer's experiences in foster care and his difficulty navigating the "normal" world with the dark shadows of his abuse and of his mother's actual presence in his life looming over him.In this installment, Pelzer narrates his life from his enlistment in the Air Force at age 18 to the present day. While all three books show the consequences of profound cruelty with a frank immediacy and gut-wrenching, carefully chosen detail, they are -- as the subtitle of this final installment of the trilogy suggests -- ardently inspirational works. Pelzer's thematic focus is forgiveness and the ability of the human spirit to triumph over adversity. Pelzer demonstrates that it is possible to channel feelings and experiences of trauma into positive energy.Pelzer includes just enough flashback and summary material that the reader new to his work has a complete grasp of the scope of his mother's abuse and his experiences in foster care. And those fans who have read his previous work will findA Man Named Daveto be an essential, capping complement toA Child Called "It"andThe Lost Boy.A Man Named Davedescribes Pelzer's more recent experiences and affords readers access to a more mature, gradually ripening adult perspective during Pelzer's agonizing struggle to confront the demons of his past and conquer them. To read all three works in sequence is, therefore, to experience a voyage from darkness with only a glimmer of hope to full illumination.ThroughoutA Man Named Dave, Pelzer carries with him a touchstone memory from his childhood, on which he ruminates and to which he returns in his most acute moments of distress. The memory is from his very early childhood, when he and his father had a tender talk alone during a family outing to the Russian River. This is an immensely precious memory for Pelzer, who has an abiding love for the father who mostly stood by or was absent during the long period of his mother's abuse. This treasured fragment from the past serves as a driving force in Pelzer's adult life -- he dreams of building a house on the Russian River and ultimately, living there with his father.Sadly, this is not to be. Pelzer joins the Air Force with the intention of becoming a firefighter, which, for a time, was his father's occupation as well, and while there, he writes letter after letter to his father, who responds only once, in a mostly illegible, scrawling letter that includes no return address. Pelzer fears that his father is lost to alcoholism and vagrant wandering. When Pelzer is finally alerted to the fact that his father is near death, he rushes to be with him. Pelzer's dying father is barely able to communicate, but in spending his final days by his father's side, Pelzer is able to begin to confront his childhood and to form a positive, productive link to his traumatic past. One of his father's final actions is to pass his cherished fire department badge on to his son.The death of Pelzer's father means that he must also confront his mother, who, though she would have little to do with her husband during his decline and death, makes her son feel ostracized and uncomfortable at the funeral. The full-grown Pelzer, an outwardly successful man in an Air Force uniform, must struggle to avoid becoming a craven boy in her presence once again. The narrative is punctuated with such excruciating encounters between Pelzer and his mother.Despite the fact that his mother no longer has any physical or legal power over him, Pelzer is still dominated by her presence. The scenes provide a telling portrayal of the consequences of childhood trauma and illustrate the almost epic immensity of Pelzer's ultimately successful struggle to overcome the legacy of his mother's abuse.Essential to this struggle is that Pelzer realizes despite the welling of powerful emotions inside of him, he must do all he can to not hate his mother or wreak vengeance on her in any form. If he is to "break the cycle" of abuse, he must confront his childhood and its effects on his adult life. It is this triumphal will -- to come to grips with his past and somehow transmute its effects on his character into a positive view of himself and the world he inhabits -- that forces Pelzer to seek out and speak with his mother despite his instinct to run from this past and hide it from ot...Show more"	"339"	"September 1, 2000"	"Nonfiction; Memoir; Biography; Autobiography; Psychology; True Story; Biography Memoir"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780452281905"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73864.A_Man_Named_Dave"

"Inferno"	"La Divina Commedia"	"Dante Alighieri; Anthony Esolen"	"4.03"	"204,259"	"9,799"	"Professor Esolen's translation of Dante's Inferno is the best one I have seen, for two reasons. His decision to use unrhymed blank verse allows him to come nearly as close to the meaning of the original as any prose reading could do, and allows him also to avoid the harrowing sacrifices that the demand for rhyme imposes on any translator. And his endnotes and other additions provoke answers to almost any question that could arise about the work." —A. Kent HieattA groundbreaking bilingual edition of Dante's masterpiece that includes a substantive Introduction, extensive notes, and appendixes that reproduce Dante's key sources and influences. Of the great poets, Dante is one of the most elusive and therefore one of the most difficult to adequately render into English verse. With this major new translation, Anthony Esolen has succeeded brilliantly in marrying sense with sound, poetry with meaning, capturing both the poem's line-by-line vigor and its allegorically and philosophically exacting structure, yielding an Inferno that will be as popular with general readers as with scholars, teachers, and students. For, as Dante insists, without a trace of sentimentality or intellectual compromise, even Hell is a work of divine art.Esolen's edition also provides a critical ntroduction and endnotes, with appendices containing Dante's most important sources—from Virgil to Saint Thomas Aquinas and beyond —that deftly illuminate the religious universe the poet inhabited.Verse Translation by Anthony EsolenIllustrations by Gustave DoréShow more"	"490"	"December 18, 2022"	"Classics; Poetry; Fiction; Literature; Religion; Fantasy; School"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780812970067"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15645.Inferno"

Written in the author's early forties in the last years of the fourth century A.D. and during his first years as a bishop, they reflect on his life and on the activity of remembering and interpreting a life. Books I-IV are concerned with infancy and learning to talk, schooldays, sexual desire and adolescent rebellion, intense friendships and intellectual exploration. Augustine evolves and analyses his past with all the resources of the reading which shaped his mind: Virgil and Cicero, Neoplatonism and the Bible. This volume, which aims to be usable by students who are new to Augustine, alerts readers to the verbal echoes and allusions of Augustine's brilliant and varied Latin, and explains his theological and philosophical questioning of what God is and what it is to be human.

"Troilus and Criseyde"	"None"	"Geoffrey Chaucer; Nevill Coghill"	"3.75"	"7,169"	"373"	"Considered one of Chaucer’s finest poems, second only to The Canterbury Tales in richness and depth, Troilus and Cressida is a tragic love story set against the background of the siege of Troy by the Greeks. Written in the 1380s, it presents Troilus, son of Priam and younger brother of Hector as a Trojan warrior of renown who sees, and falls deeply in love with the beautiful Cressida. Cressida is the daughter of Calchas, a Trojan priest and seer who, having divined the eventual fall of Troy, has deserted to Agamemnon’s camp, leaving his daughter in the besieged city, With the help of Pander, friend to Troilus and uncle to Cressida, the young couple meet and merge – but with unhappy consequences. Chaucer’s long poem is cast in seven-line rhymed stanzas, and is eased out of Middle English to be presented here in a lively modern verse translation by George Philip Krapp, who has retained not only the structure, but its spirit. Emotions run high, the love is intense, the story unfolds with a dramatic urgency that draws the listener ever onwards; yet Chaucer is Chaucer, and there are times when a deft line, a light insinuation, suggests the smile, the benevolence and the immediacy of the author of The Canterbury Tales. Troilus and Cressida, though often overshadowed by the Tales and time (and even Shakespeare who took up the story) is a monument in its own right in the canon of English literature. Once read it will never be forgotten.Show more"	"368"	"April 30, 1971"	"Poetry; Classics; Medieval; Fiction; Literature; Romance; School"	"Troy"	"Criseyde,Troilus"	"9780140442397"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/820905.Troilus_and_Criseyde"

Come nell’Amleto tutto è doppio, a cominciare dal suo protagonista principe e clown, tragico e comico, così nel Troilo tutto è bifronte, tutto si sdoppia. Dramma ‘dialettico’, o commedia ‘amara’, molto amara, addirittura dark, Troilo e Cressida si incentra sulla demoralizzazione degli eroi, sulla disintegrazione dei valori. Domina un sentimento di corruzione, di marciume – altro che in Danimarca! Qui ci sono eroi arrivati a uno stadio di degenerazione quasi teppistica. Ci sono amanti, il cui amore si liquefa in una lubrica promiscuità. Le virtù positive della fedeltà e della devozione si putrefanno, i valori si degradano. […] In immediata apertura, del resto, il Prologo in armi avanza per dire agli spettatori che si mettano a proprio agio, e si dispongano all’inquietante verità che in guerra il male e il bene si confondono. L’etica è il primo danno collaterale della guerra, il primo valore a perdersi. Di seguito periscono l’amore, l’onore, la speranza.

It was written at the end of the fifth century BCE in Athens, in the final years of the "Golden Age" of Athenian culture, and in the last year of Sophocles' own life. At the center of the play is the mysterious transformation of Oedipus from an old and blind beggar, totally dependent on his daughters, to the man who rises from his seat and, without help, leads everyone to the place where he is destined to die. In the background of this transformation stands the grove of the Furies, the sacred place of the implacable goddesses who pursue the violators of blood relationships. Although Oedipus, who killed his father and married his mother, is an obvious target of the Furies' vengeance, he enters their grove at the beginning of the play, sure that it is the resting place Apollo has predicted for him. The reversals and paradoxes in the play speak to the struggle that Oedipus' life and the action of the play bring vividly before how do we as humans, subject to constant change, find stable ground on which to stand and define our moral lives? Sophocles offers his play as a witness to the remarkable human capacity to persevere in this struggle.Show more"	"144"	"December 16, 2004"	"Plays; Classics; Drama; Fiction; Mythology; Theatre; Tragedy"	"Unknown"	"Antigone,Ismene,Oedipus,Theseus (mythology),Polynices (son of Oedipus),Creon"	"9780195135046"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148313.Oedipus_at_Colonus"

"Alcestis"	"None"	"Euripides; William Arrowsmith"	"3.86"	"5,007"	"452"	"At once a vigorous translation of one of Euripides' most subtle and witty plays, and a wholly fresh interpretation, this version reveals for the first time the extraordinary formal beauty and thematic concentration of the Alcestis. William Arrowsmith, eminent classical scholar, translator, and General Editor of this highly praised series, rejects the standard view of the Alcestis as a psychological study of the egotist Admetos and his naive but devoted wife. His translation, instead, presents the play as a drama of human existence-in keeping with the tradition of Greek tragedy-with recognizably human characters who also represent masked embodiments of human conditions. The Alcestis thus becomes a metaphysical tragicomedy in which Admetos, who has heretofore led a life without limitations, learns to "think mortal thoughts." He acquires the knowledge of limits-the acceptance of death as well as the duty to live-which, according to Euripides, makes people meaningfully human and capable of both courage and compassion. This new interpretation compellingly argues that, for Euripides, suffering humanizes, that exemption makes a man selfish and childish, and that only the courage to accept both life and death leads to the realization of one's humanity, and, in the case of Alcestis, to heroism.Show more"	"142"	"February 1, 1990"	"Plays; Classics; Drama; Mythology; Fiction; Theatre; Poetry"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780195061666"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1494.Alcestis"

A female ruler, once an orphan raised on the outskirts of an empire - certainly no one in Ancient Assyria would bend to her command willingly. Semiramis was a woman who knew if she wanted power, she would have to claim it.There are whispers of her fame in Mesopotamian myth- Semiramis was a queen, an ambitious warrior, a commander whose reputation reaches the majestic proportions of Alexander the Great. Historical record, on the other hand, falls eerily quiet.In her second novel, Costanza Casati brilliantly weaves myth and ancient history together to give Semiramis a voice, charting her captivating ascent to a throne no one promised her. The world Casati expertly builds is rich with dazzling detail and will transport her readers to the heat of the Assyrian Empire and a world long gone.Show more"	"432"	"January 14, 2025"	"Historical Fiction; Mythology; Fantasy; Fiction; Historical; Retellings; Greek Mythology"	"Mesopotamia(Iraq),Assyria,Ancient Akkadian Empire"	"Unknown"	"9781464228216"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210204151-babylonia"

"Cloud Atlas"	"None"	"David  Mitchell"	"4.01"	"266,048"	"23,615"	"A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.Cloud Atlasbegins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.But the story doesn't end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan,Cloud Atlasis an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.Show more"	"509"	"August 17, 2004"	"Fiction; Science Fiction; Fantasy; Historical Fiction; Dystopia; Book Club; Literary Fiction"	"Chatham Islands(New Zealand),Neerbeke, West Vlaanderen(Belgium),Buenas Yerbas(United States),London, England,Seoul, South Korea(Korea, Republic of),Maui, Hawaii(United States),Belgium,The United States of America,England,South Korea(Korea, Republic of)"	"Adam Ewing,Autua,Dr. Goose,Robert Frobisher,Rufus Sixsmith,Vyvyan Ayrs,Jocasta Ayrs,Eva van Outryve de Crommelynck,Luisa Rey,Timothy Cavendish,Sonmi~451,Zachry,Meronym,Hae-Joo Im,Mr. Meeks,Ernie Blacksmith,Nurse Noakes,Javier Gomez,Fay Li,Bill Smoke,Joe Napier,Yoona-939,Isaac Sachs,Old Georgie"	"9780375507250"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49628.Cloud_Atlas"

In contemporary life, we are more often met with red tape and to-do lists. This is exactly what happened to Geraldine Brooks when her partner of more than three decades, Tony Horwitz – just sixty years old and, to her knowledge, vigorous and healthy – collapsed and died on a Washington, D. C. sidewalk.After spending their early years together in conflict zones as foreign correspondents, Geraldine and Tony settled down to raise two boys on Martha’s Vineyard.

There they opened a library meant to celebrate the freedom of ideas and gathered every book on the banned list . . . and even incognito versions of the forbidden books that were smuggled back into Germany.For the last six years, Corinne Bastien has been reading those books and making that library a second home.

"Tears and Saints"	"None"	"Emil M. Cioran; Ilinca Zarifopol-Johnston"	"4.06"	"2,427"	"260"	"By the mid-1930s, Emil Cioran was already known as a leader of a new generation of politically committed Romanian intellectuals. Researching another, more radical book, Cioran was spending hours in a library poring over the lives of saints. As a modern hagiographer, Cioran "dreamt" himself "the chronicler of these saints' falls between heaven and earth, the intimate knower of the ardors in their hearts, the historian of God's insomniacs." Inspired by Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil , Cioran "searched for the origin of tears." He asked himself if saints could be "the sources of tears' better light.""Who can tell?" he wrote in the first paragraph of this book, first published in Romania in 1937. "To be sure, tears are their trace. Tears did not enter the world through the saints; but without them we would never have known that we cry because we long for a lost paradise." By following in their traces, "wetting the soles of one's feet in their tears," Cioran hoped to understand how a human being can renounce being human. Written in Cioran's characteristic aphoristic style, this flamboyant, bold, and provocative book is one of his most important—and revelatory—works.Cioran focuses not on martyrs or heroes but on the mystics—primarily female—famous for their keening spirituality and intimate knowledge of God. Their Christianity was anti-theological, anti-institutional, and based solely on intuition and sentiment. Many, such as Catherine of Siena, Teresa of Avila, and Saint John of the Cross, have produced classic works of mystical literature; but Cioran celebrates many more minor and unusual figures as well.Following Nietzsche, he focuses explicitly on the political element hidden in saints' lives. In his hands, however, their charitable deeds are much less interesting than their thirst for pain and their equally powerful capacity to endure it. Behind their suffering and their uncanny ability to renounce everything through ascetic practices, Cioran detects a fanatical will to power."Like Nietzsche, Cioran is an important religious thinker. His book intertwines God and music with passion and tears. . . . [ Tears and Saints ] has a chillingly contemporary ring that makes this translation important here and now."— BooklistShow more"	"154"	"July 6, 1998"	"Philosophy; Nonfiction; Religion; Romanian Literature; Essays; Romania; Theology"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780226106748"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/300448.Tears_and_Saints"

Muslims believe the Quran to be verbally revealed through the angel Jibrīl (Gabriel) from God to Muhammad gradually over a period of approximately 23 years beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death.Muslims regard the Quran as the main miracle of Muhammad, the proof of his prophethood and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam, regarded in Islam as the first prophet, and continued with Suhuf Ibrahim (Scrolls of Abraham), the Tawrat (Torah or Pentateuch) of Moses, the Zabur (Tehillim or Book of Psalms) of David, and the Injil (Gospel) of Jesus. The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in Jewish and Christian scriptures, summarizing some, dwelling at length on others and in some cases presenting alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance, sometimes offering detailed accounts of specific historical events, and often emphasizing the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.Show more"	"604"	"January 1, 650"	"Religion; Islam; Nonfiction; Classics; Philosophy; Spirituality; Reference"	"Mekka and Madina(Saudi Arabia)"	"Moses,Jesus,Abraham (Bible),Adam (Bible),Mary (mother of Jesus)"	"Unknown"	"Arabic"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/646462._"

Karen Armstrong's short history offers a vital corrective to this narrow view. The distillation of years of thinking and writing about Islam, it demonstrates that the world's fastest-growing faith is a much richer and more complex phenomenon than its modern fundamentalist strain might suggest.Islam: A Short History begins with the flight of Muhammad and his family from Medina in the seventh century and the subsequent founding of the first mosques. It recounts the origins of the split between Shii and Sunni Muslims, and the emergence of Sufi mysticism; the spread of Islam throughout North Africa, the Levant, and Asia; the shattering effect on the Muslim world of the Crusades; the flowering of imperial Islam in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries into the world's greatest and most sophisticated power; and the origins and impact of revolutionary Islam. It concludes with an assessment of Islam today and its challenges.With this brilliant book, Karen Armstrong issues a forceful challenge to those who hold the view that the West and Islam are civilizations set on a collision course.

"Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia"	"None"	"Marya Hornbacher"	"4.03"	"34,022"	"1,505"	"Precociously intelligent, imaginative, energetic and ambitious, Marya Hornbacher grew up in a comfortable middle-class American home. At the age of five, she returned from a ballet class one day, put on an enormous sweater, curled up on her bed and cried -- because she thought she was fat. By age nine, she was secretly bulimic, throwing up at home after school while watching The Brady Bunch reruns on television and munching Fritos. She added anorexia to her repertoire a few years later and took great pride in her ability to starve.Why would a talented young girl go through the looking glass and step into a netherworld where up is down and food is greed, where death is honor and flesh is weak? Why enter into a love affair with hunger, drugs, sex and death? Marya Hornbacher sustained both anorexia and bulimia through five lengthy hospitalizations, endless therapy, the loss of family, friends, jobs and, ultimately, any sense of what it meant to be "normal."In this vivid, emotionally wrenching memoir, she re-creates the experience and illuminates the tangle of personal, family and cultural causes that underlie eating disorders. Hornbacher's story gathers intensity with each passing year. By the time she is in college and working for a news service in Washington, DC, she is in the grip of a such a horrifying bout with anorexia that it will forever put to rest the romance of wasting away. Down to 52 pounds and counting, Hornbacher's body becomes a the death instinct with the drive to live, mind and body locked in mortal combat.Wastedis the story of one woman's travels to the darker side of reality, and her decision to find her way back -- on her own terms. A landmark book from a 23-year-old writer of virtuoso prose,Wastedtakes us inside the experience of anorexia and bulimia in a way that no one else has ever done.Show more"	"298"	"January 31, 2006"	"Memoir; Nonfiction; Psychology; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Biography; Biography Memoir"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780060858797"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46815.Wasted"
"Unbearable Lightness: A Story of Loss and Gain"	"None"	"Portia de Rossi"	"3.83"	"41,653"	"2,652"	"“I didn’t decide to become anorexic. It snuck up on me disguised as a healthy diet, a professional attitude. Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . .”Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard work—first as a child model in Australia, then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond, glamorous and successful. On the inside, she was literally dying.In this searing, unflinchingly honest book, Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food, weight, and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day, from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn’t enough, she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise, driving her body and spirit to the breaking point.Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows Ally McBeal and Arrested Development, Portia alternately starved herself and binged, all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet, a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet, Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder.From her lowest point, Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty, falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres, and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women’s health issues.In this remarkable and beautifully written work, Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject. A crucial book for all those who might sometimes feel at war with themselves or their bodies, Unbearable Lightness is a story that inspires hope and nourishes the spirit.Show more"	"320"	"November 1, 2010"	"Nonfiction; Memoir; Biography; Autobiography; Mental Health; LGBT; Biography Memoir"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781439177808"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9219901-unbearable-lightness"

But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves.As Kelsier's protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her.Stopping assassins may keep Vin's Mistborn skills sharp, but it's the least of her problems. Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesn't run itself, and Vin and the other members of Kelsier's crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly won't get easier with three armies - one of them composed of ferocious giants - now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord Ruler's hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal.As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope.

If he wanted to survive, he had no room for weakness.Max Nowaz’s science fiction novel, The Arbitrator, follows the story of 153 year-old Jim Brown, a former highly successful administrator who is now rotting in jail, for tax fraud. However, in reality, he is there for taking revenge and killing several people on the planet Levita, after meeting the beautiful Narissa...In prison, he has acquired a drug habit, which is killing him slowly and his only chance of survival is a very expensive renewal process, which will make him young again and cure his drug habit. After ten years in jail, he is suddenly given a reprieve and offered a chance to redeem himself. He is sent as the ‘Arbitrator’ to ‘Pirrus’ in another solar system, to try and stop a rebellion and bring matters under control. Will he complete the mission successfully to earn enough funds for his regeneration? Only time will tell.This novel tries to portray realistically, the darker side of colonisation, where a population is ruthlessly exploited in the guise of bringing them civilisation. Brown, a well-oiled cog in such a system prides himself on being ruthlessly efficient in his tyrannical task of keeping the population down, has a change of heart after meeting Gina, a girl he uses as his plaything.He then slowly embarks on a path of self-emancipation in trying to better the lot of the people under his charge. He is not only up against his own government, the EPA, but also against other forces trying to overthrow him. He also discovers a plot by some external powers trying to invade the planet and is hurled into an epic adventure in a game of survival.This novel may not be everybody's cup of tea, because of its complex political undertones as it tries to show the insidious underbelly of an autocratic form of colonisation, though it can be enjoyed simply as a great Sci-Fi adventure story.Show more"	"229"	"September 25, 2019"	"Science Fiction; Fiction; Science Fiction Fantasy; Ebooks; Teen; Book Club; Young Adult"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781785892134"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30760409-the-arbitrator"

Leif Enger's debut,Peace Like a River, is one such work. His richly evocative novel, narrated by an asthmatic 11-year-old named Reuben Land, is the story of Reuben's unusual family and their journey across the frozen Badlands of the Dakotas in search of his fugitive older brother. Charged with the murder of two locals who terrorized their family, Davy has fled, understanding that the scales of justice will not weigh in his favor. But Reuben, his father, Jeremiah—a man of faith so deep he has been known to produce miracles—and Reuben's little sister, Swede, follow closely behind the fleeing Davy.Affecting and dynamic,Peace Like a Riveris at once a tragedy, a romance, and an unflagging exploration into the spirituality and magic possible in the everyday world, and in that of the world awaiting us on the other side of life. In Enger's superb debut effort, we witness a wondrous celebration of family, faith, and spirit, the likes of which we haven't seen in a long, long time—and the birth of a classic work of literature.Show more"	"312"	"January 1, 2001"	"Fiction; Book Club; Historical Fiction; Literary Fiction; Coming Of Age; Novels; Audiobook"	"The United States of America,North Dakota(United States)"	"Rube Land,Swede Land,Davy Land,Jeremiah Land"	"9780802139252"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227571.Peace_Like_a_River"

We are meant to go in and out of doors in civilized style, but my mother bade me climb into woodsy wildness and a darkness flushed with crimson light and torches ..." Clambering into the branches of a tree, a young woman flees flaming arrows and massacre. She will need to struggle for to scour the wilderness for shelter, to strive and seek for a new family and a setting where she can belong. Her unmarked way is costly and hard. For Charis, the world outside the window of home is a maze of hazards. And even if she survives the wilds, it is no simple matter to discover and nest among her own kind--the godly, those called Puritans by others. She may be tugged by her desires for companionship, may even stumble into an intense love for a man, and may be made to try the strength of female heroism in ways no longer familiar to women in our century. Streams of darkness run through the seventeenth-century villages of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Occult fears have a way of creeping into the mind. What young woman can be safe from the dangers of wilderness when its shadowy thickets spring up so easily in the soil of human hearts? Much will oppose Charis' longings for renewal and peace; she must pursue and discover the hero's path to a larger, more vivid life.Show more"	"331"	"February 18, 2020"	"Fiction; Historical Fiction; Book Club; Novels; American; Adult; Historical"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781621643043"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48947485-charis-in-the-world-of-wonders"

We must merely open our hearts to receive Him and His loving presence.As a humble cook, Brother Lawrence learned an important lesson through each daily chore: The time he spent in communion with the Lord should be the same, whether he was bustling around in the kitchen—with several people asking questions at the same time—or on his knees in prayer. He learned to cultivate the deep presence of God so thoroughly in his own heart that he was able to joyfully exclaim, “I am doing now what I will do for all eternity. I am blessing God, praising Him, adoring Him, and loving Him with all my heart.”This unparalleled classic has given both blessing and instruction to those who can be content with nothing less than knowing God in all His majesty and feeling His loving presence throughout each simple day.Show more"	"95"	"June 1, 1982"	"Christian; Nonfiction; Religion; Christianity; Faith; Spirituality; Theology"	"France"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/498641.The_Practice_of_the_Presence_of_God"

Her love for its supernatural history has flourished into a career, as she guides the one and only ghost tour through the town’s can’t-miss haunted spots.

"Ten Years Later"	"None"	"Alexandre Dumas"	"3.97"	"3,041"	"90"	"This antiquarian book contains Alexandre Dumas’s historical novel "Ten Years Later". Serialised between 1847 and 1850, this is the second instalment of the final episode in the d’Artagnan Romances. Set between 1660 and 1667, it chronicles Louis XIV’s metamorphosis from juvenile monarch to Sun King. A veritably thrilling romantic romp in seventeenth century France, “Ten Years Later” constitutes a must-read for fans of Dumas’s seminal work, and would make for a worthy addition to any collection. Alexandre Dumas (1802–1870) was a famous French writer. He is best remembered for his exciting romantic sagas, including "The Three Musketeers" and "The Count of Monte Cristo". Despite making a great deal of money from his writing, Dumas was almost perpetually penniless thanks to his decidedly extravagant lifestyle. His novels have been translated into nearly a hundred different languages, and have inspired over 200 motion pictures. Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive.

This Penguin Classics edition is translated by Ronald Wilks with an introduction by Donald Rayfield.This collection of Chekhov's finest early writing is headlined by 'The Steppe', which established his reputation, telling the unforgettable tale of a boy's journey to a new school in Kiev, travelling through majestic landscapes towards an unknown destiny. 'Gusev' depicts an ocean voyage, where the sea takes on a terrifying, primeval power; 'The Kiss' portrays a shy soldier's failed romantic encounter; and in 'The Duel' two men's enmity ends in farce. Haunting and highly atmospheric, all the stories in this volume show a writer emerging from the shadow of his masters - great Russian writers such as Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Turgenev and Nikolai Gogol - and discovering his own voice. They also illustrate Chekhov's genius for evoking the natural world and exploring inner lives.This is the first of three chronological volumes of Chekhov's short stories in Penguin Classics. Ronald Wilks's delicate translation is accompanied by a chronology and explanatory notes. This edition also contains an introduction and annotated bibliography by internationally renowned Chekhov scholar Donald Rayfield.Anton Chekhov (1860-1904) was born in Taganrog, a port on the sea of Azov. In 1879 he travelled to Moscow, where he entered the medical faculty of the university, graduating in 1884. During his university years, he supported his family by contributing humorous stories and sketches to magazines. He published his first volume of stories,Motley Tales, in 1886, and a year later his second volumeIn the Twilight,for which he received the Pushkin Prize. Today his plays, including 'Uncle Vanya', 'The Seagull', and 'The Cherry Orchard' are recognised as masterpieces the world over.If you enjoyedThe Steppe, you might like Chekhov'sThe Lady with the Little Dog and Other Stories, also available in Penguin Classics.Show more"	"416"	"October 25, 2001"	"Classics; Short Stories; Fiction; Russia; Russian Literature; Literature; 19th Century"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780140447859"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114606.The_Steppe_and_Other_Stories_1887_91"

"Le Collier de la Reine: Volume 1"	"None"	"Alexandre Dumas"	"4.02"	"178"	"14"	"A sequel to the "Mémoires d'un Médecin," and the second of the "Marie-Antoinette Series." Written in collaboration with Auguste Maquet. The picturesque tragedy of the diamond necklace, so much written of, is here narrated in Dumas' best style. Period 1784-1785. In a brief introduction Dumas refers to the Revolution of 1848, just accomplished, and to his foretelling of it in 1832, in "Gaule et France." Interesting comparison might well be made with passages in the author's journal, "Le Mois." (See page 236.) The prologue is borrowed from La Harpe's "Prophétie de Cazotte," but Dumas has instilled into it a vast deal more spirit and life. It is curious to note that Bulwer Lytton also uses La Harpe's clever work, but with far less skill than the original possesses, in his "Zanoni." This is generally classed as the last of the most famous or "great" novels in which Maquet collaborated ; it is a very fine piece of work, and is usually considered to be a favourite with English readers. Certainly it moves steadily and uninterruptedly to its conclusion, and there are not too many threads to be followed. It first appeared as a feuilleton in "La Presse."

Sexual attraction is shown as a game that often turns sour, an experience that brings with it painful insights and releases uncertainty, panic, vanity and a constant need for reassurance. Thus a young couple on holiday start a game of pretence that threatens to destroy their relationship, two middle-aged men go in search of girls they don't really want, a young man renews contact with an older woman who feels humiliated by her ageing body, an elderly doctor uses his beautiful wife to increase his attraction and minister to his sexual vanity.

As Zen has taken root in Western soil, it has incorporated much of the attitude and approach set forth by Watts inThe Way of Zen, which remains one of the most important introductory books in Western Zen.Show more"	"236"	"January 26, 1999"	"Philosophy; Spirituality; Buddhism; Nonfiction; Religion; Zen; Self Help"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780375705106"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/514210.The_Way_of_Zen"

Although the tradition that traces its ancestry back to him did not flourish until nearly two hundred years after his death, today millions of Zen Buddhists and students of kung fu claim him as their spiritual father.While others viewed Zen practice as a purification of the mind or a stage on the way to perfect enlightenment, Bodhidharma equated Zen with buddhahood and believed that it had a place in everyday life. Instead of telling his disciples to purify their minds, he pointed them to rock walls, to the movements of tigers and cranes, to a hollow reed floating across the Yangtze.This bilingual edition, the only volume of the great teacher's work currently available in English, presents four teachings in their entirety. "Outline of Practice" describes the four all-inclusive habits that lead to enlightenment, the "Bloodstream Sermon" exhorts students to seek the Buddha by seeing their own nature, the "Wake-up Sermon" defends his premise that the most essential method for reaching enlightenment is beholding the mind.

Assassin Celaena Sardothien won a brutal contest to become his Champion. Yet Celaena is far from loyal to the crown. She hides her secret vigilantly; she knows that the man she serves is bent on evil.Keeping up the deadly charade becomes increasingly difficult when Celaena realizes she is not the only one seeking justice. As she tries to untangle the mysteries buried deep within the glass castle, her closest relationships suffer.

"Davinci Code by Unknown"	"None"	"Palibor Iversune"	"4.61"	"1,165"	"6"	"Ancient Greek Paganism revolves around a family story legendarily beginning upon the creation of the universe. Such primordial mythology reveals titanic power struggle within family hierarchy; Cronus the patriarch, Zeus his son, and Hermes (son of Zeus).As per the story (or myth), Cronus desperately swallowed his baby boy (Zeus) to preserve his own power. This monstrous act was diabolically enheartened by an oracle predicting that the unborn Zeus would grow to overthrow Cronus just as Cronus overthrew his father (Uranus).Hermes is said to carry a staff—the Caduceus, adorned with snakes and wings—currently serving as an institutional symbol for modern medicine. Is as much potentially troublesome? Should Hermes’s ‘magic wand’ be instituted as an emblem for public health? Have modern symbologists missed something here? Any potential occultic affects (or effects) possibly overlooked?Hermes is innately of Hermeticism. Hermeticism is regarded as a time-tested metaphysical (or theistic) philosophy that has historically thrived within ‘secretive societies’ of Western Esotericism. Throughout recent centuries, Hermeticism has apparently been conditioned to fade from public consciousness whereby being generally ignored by Establishment institutions seems of mutual design.As illustrated within DaVinci’s Mental Code, Hermeticism connects—across time—the following historical prominent Roman (Byzantine) leaders of Christians; King Henry VIII; Medici family members; Giovanni Pico della Mirandola; Renaissance Venetians; Leonardo da Vinci.The book contains theory contending that whether centuries ago, or today, Hermeticism carries an inherent danger upon which Vitruvian Man (DaVinci’s enigmatic drawing) is proposed to issue timeless warning.Theoretically, Leonardo grew wary of Hermeticism and created his Vitruvian Man (in part) to help shine light on such a predacious doctrine as it Darkly slithered about Renaissance Italy.DaVinci’s Mental Code began shaping once Vitruvian Man’s left eye was revealed to look much Darker than his right eye, while the ‘dual’ Hermetic principle seemed philosophically (or conceptually) connected.Show more"	"Unknown"	"Bantam Press"	"Mystery"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148344142-davinci-code-by-unknown"

"Agatha Christie: Murder in the Making: More Stories and Secrets from Her Notebooks"	"None"	"John  Curran"	"4.36"	"1,691"	"64"	"In this follow-up volume to the award-winning 'Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks', Christie archivist and expert John Curran leads the reader through the six decades of Agatha's writing career, unearthing some remarkable clues to her success and a number of never-before-published excerpts and stories from her archives.Starting his investigation in the 1920s, John Curran examines the conventions of detective fiction as it existed then and reveals how Agatha Christie's publisher talked her into changing the ending of her very first book, 'The Mysterious Affair at Styles', a move that almost certainly changed the fortunes of not only her career but also the future of the detective novel. For the very first time, this book prints Agatha's original ending, painstakingly transcribed from the hand-written draft in one of her earliest notebooks.Every decade saw Agatha Christie's success grow to new heights. The emergence of the world-famous Collins Crime Club in 1930 brought with it the very first Miss Marple novel; the austerity of the 1940s had Agatha Christie preparing to kill off Hercule Poirot; and the 1950s saw her experiment increasingly with stories influenced by more modern thrillers. Focusing on more than 20 Christie novels as detailed evidence, John Curran demonstrates the evolution of Agatha's writing through the decades, including her perseverance through the Swinging Sixties and Seventies into old age, concluding with a look at Agatha's last notebook and her ideas for an unwritten final book.As well as revealing more than a dozen unpublished book ideas, 'Agatha Christie's Murder in the Making' contains two new short stories from her archives - 'The Man Who Knew' and an early Miss Marple draft, 'The Case of the Caretaker's Wife'.NB: The first edition, first printing, has the ISBN on the reverse of the title page as in this record of the book but the back of the dust wrapper carries a different ISBN - 9780007908561!

The crime writer was found 11 days later in a hotel in Harrogate,Yorkshire, claiming to be the victim of amnesia. Up till now none of her biographers has come up with conclusive evidence as to what Agatha Christie did in the first 24 hours after she disappeared or whether her memory loss was genuine. Although the notoriety made Agatha Christie famous, she never recovered from the intense press scrutiny, and the private anguish that surrounded the episode ensured that she made no reference to it in her memoirs. Illustrated with many hitherto unpublished photographs, Jared Cade's riveting book—on which a BBC television documentary has been based—provides all the answers, including startling accounts by the novelist's surviving relatives, that reveal for the first time why she staged the disappearance with the help of a co-conspiritor and how it all went terribly wrong.Show more"	"256"	"September 1, 2006"	"Nonfiction; Agatha Christie; Biography; Mystery; True Crime; History; British Literature"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780720612806"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131356.Agatha_Christie_and_the_Eleven_Missing_Days"

In the early 1800s, the Mvskoke people were forcibly removed from their original lands east of the Mississippi to Indian Territory, which is now part of Oklahoma. Two hundred years later, Joy Harjo returns to her family’s lands and opens a dialogue with history. In An American Sunrise , Harjo finds blessings in the abundance of her homeland and confronts the site where her people, and other indigenous families, essentially disappeared. From her memory of her mother’s death, to her beginnings in the native rights movement, to the fresh road with her beloved, Harjo’s personal life intertwines with tribal histories to create a space for renewed beginnings. Her poems sing of beauty and survival, illuminating a spirituality that connects her to her ancestors and thrums with the quiet anger of living in the ruins of injustice.

"Some Thing Black"	"None"	"Jacques Roubaud; Rosmarie Waldrop"	"4.10"	"433"	"58"	"In 1983 Jacques Roubaud’s wife Alix Cleo died at the age of 31 of a pulmonary embolism. The grief-stricken author responded with one brief poem (“Nothing”), then fell silent for thirty months. In subsequent years, Roubaud―poet, novelist, mathematician―composed a series of prose poems, a collection that is a profound mediation on the experience of death, the devastation it brings to the lover who goes on living, and the love that remains. Despite the universality of this experience, no other writer has so devoted himself to exploring and recording the many-edged forms of grief, mourning, bewilderment, emptiness, and loneliness that attend death. No other writer has provided a kind of solace while facing with honesty and hardness the intricate ways in which the living are affected by such a loss. Some Thing Black is an ongoing monologue from Roubaud to his wife, as death assaults the mind’s failure to comprehend absence. Roubaud both refuses to and cannot surrender his wife to the past (“I always wake up in your voice, your hand, your smell”). The death, having occurred in an instant of time, goes on in him (“But inside me your death proceeds slowly, incomprehensibly”). While acknowledging “death calls for a poetry of meditation,” Roubaud is enraged at the limitations of language and words to affect the biological reality. Rather, all that language can do is clarify the exactness of his grief and to recall precisely the image of her life and death. But such recollection―the sight of her dead body, her photographs, her things, the rooms they lived in―becomes a “memory infinitely torturous.” And his most anguished recollection is of their making love (“These memories are the darkest of all”), and a sense of guilt for somehow not having prevented her death (“I did not save you from that difficult night”). This is a brave and honest book that does not disguise that pain of loss. Its nobility, grace, and humanity rest in its refusal to falsify death’s harsh presence (“This dirty rotten life to be mixed up with death”) and in its acceptance of the mind’s limitations (“I do not understand”). This moving, compassionate, uncompromising book is one of the most significant works of our time. Included in this edition is a portfolio of photographs made by Roubaud’s wife in 1980 entitled “If Some Thing Black.”Show more"	"144"	"January 1, 1990"	"Poetry; France; Literature; French Literature; Death; Grief; Love"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780916583484"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1138622.Some_Thing_Black"

Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt interweaves a first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.The story is peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the "soul of pampered self-absorption"; the uproarious black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else.Show more"	"386"	"June 28, 1999"	"Nonfiction; True Crime; Mystery; Book Club; Crime; History; Classics"	"Savannah, Georgia(United States)"	"Jim Williams,Danny Hansford,Lucille Wright,Mary Harty,Joe Odom,Mandy Nichols,William Simon Glover,Luther Driggers,Serena Vaughn Dawes,Johnny Mercer,Emma Kelly,Chablis,Lee Adler,Conrad Aiken,Spencer Lawton Jr.,Minerva,Sonny Seiler"	"9780679751526"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386187.Midnight_in_the_Garden_of_Good_and_Evil"

"Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields"	"None"	"Wendy Lower"	"3.60"	"5,950"	"803"	"History has it that the role of women in Nazi Germany was to be the perfect Hausfrau, produce the next Aryan generation and be a loyal cheerleader for the Führer. Then they became the Trümmerfrauen, or Rubble Women, as they cleared and tidied their ruined country to get it back on its feet. They were Germany's heroines. The few women tried and convicted after the war were simply the evil aberrations - the camp guards, the female Nazi elite - that proved this rule.However, Wendy Lower's research into the very ordinary women who went out to the Nazi Eastern Front reveals an altogether different story. For ambitious young women, the emerging Nazi empire represented a kind of Wild East of career and matrimonial opportunity. Over half a million of them set off for these new lands, where most of the worst crimes of the Reich would occur.Through the interwoven biographies of thirteen women, the reader follows the transformation of young nurses, teachers, secretaries and wives who start out in Weimar and Nazi Germany as ambitious idealists and end up as witnesses, accomplices and perpetrators of the genocide in Ukraine, Poland and Belarus. Hitler's Furies presents overwhelming evidence that the women in these territories actively participated in the mass murder - and some became killers. In the case of women like Erna Petri, who brought her family to her husband's impressive Polish SS estate, we find brutality as chilling as any in history.Hitler's Furies is indelible proof that we have not known what we need to know about the role of women in the Nazi killing fields - or about how it could have been hidden for seventy years. It shows that genocide is women's business as well as men's and that, in ignoring women's culpability, we have ignored the reality of the Holocaust.Show more"	"288"	"October 8, 2013"	"History; Nonfiction; Holocaust; World War II; War; Germany; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780701187217"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17612712-hitler-s-furies"
"Ravensbrück: Life and Death in Hitler's Concentration Camp for Women"	"None"	"Sarah Helm"	"4.41"	"5,027"	"781"	"A groundbreaking, masterful, and absorbing account of the last hidden atrocity of World War II—Ravensbrück—the largest female-only concentration camp, where more than 100,000 women consisting of more than twenty nationalities were imprisoned.Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS and the architect of the Holocaust, oversaw the construction of a special concentration camp just fifty miles north of Berlin. He called it Ravensbrück, and during the years that followed thousands of people died there after enduring brutal forms of torture. All were women. There are a handful of studies and memoirs that reference Ravensbrück, but until now no one has written a full account of this atrocity, perhaps due to the mostly masculine narrative of war, or perhaps because it lacks the Jewish context of most mainstream Holocaust history. Ninety percent of Ravensbrück's prisoners were not Jewish. Rather, they were political prisoners, Resistance fighters, lesbians, prostitutes, even the sister of New York's Mayor LaGuardia. In a perverse twist, most of the guards were women themselves. Sarah Helm's groundbreaking work sheds much-needed light on an aspect of World War II that has remained in the shadows for decades. Using research into German and newly opened Russian archives, as well as interviews with survivors, Helm has produced a landmark achievement that weaves together various accounts, allowing us to follow characters on both sides of the prisoner/guard divide. Chilling, compelling, and deeply unsettling,Ravensbrückis essential reading for anyone concerned with Nazi history.Show more"	"743"	"March 31, 2015"	"History; Nonfiction; Holocaust; World War II; War; Historical; Germany"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780385520591"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20890478-ravensbr-ck"
"KL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps"	"None"	"Nikolaus Wachsmann"	"4.55"	"2,119"	"288"	"In a landmark work of history, Nikolaus Wachsmann offers an unprecedented, integrated account of the Nazi concentration camps from their inception in 1933 through their demise, seventy years ago, in the spring of 1945. The Third Reich has been studied in more depth than virtually any other period in history, and yet until now there has been no history of the camp system that tells the full story of its broad development and the everyday experiences of its inhabitants, both perpetrators and victims, and all those living in what Primo Levi called "the gray zone."InKL, Wachsmann fills this glaring gap in our understanding. He not only synthesizes a new generation of scholarly work, much of it untranslated and unknown outside of Germany, but also presents startling revelations, based on many years of archival research, about the functioning and scope of the camp system. Examining, close up, life and death inside the camps, and adopting a wider lens to show how the camp system was shaped by changing political, legal, social, economic, and military forces, Wachsmann produces a unified picture of the Nazi regime and its camps that we have never seen before.A boldly ambitious work of deep importance,KLis destined to be a classic in the history of the twentieth century.Show more"	"865"	"April 14, 2015"	"History; Nonfiction; Holocaust; World War II; Germany; War; European History"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780374118259"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237143-kl"

"The End: The Defiance and Destruction of Hitler's Germany 1944-45"	"None"	"Ian Kershaw"	"4.15"	"4,857"	"371"	"From the preeminent Hitler biographer, a fascinating and original exploration of how the Third Reich was willing and able to fight to the bitter end of World War II.Countless books have been written about why Nazi Germany lost World War II, yet remarkably little attention has been paid to the equally vital question of how and why it was able to hold out as long as it did. The Third Reich did not surrender until Germany had been left in ruins and almost completely occupied. Even in the near-apocalyptic final months, when the war was plainly lost, the Nazis refused to sue for peace. Historically, this is extremely rare.Drawing on original testimony from ordinary Germans and arch-Nazis alike, award-winning historian Ian Kershaw explores this fascinating question in a gripping and focused narrative that begins with the failed bomb plot in July 1944 and ends with the German capitulation in May 1945. Hitler, desperate to avoid a repeat of the "disgraceful" German surrender in 1918, was of course critical to the Third Reich's fanatical determination, but his power was sustained only because those below him were unable, or unwilling, to challenge it. Even as the military situation grew increasingly hopeless, Wehrmacht generals fought on, their orders largely obeyed, and the regime continued its ruthless persecution of Jews, prisoners, and foreign workers. Beneath the hail of allied bombing, German society maintained some semblance of normalcy in the very last months of the war. The Berlin Philharmonic even performed on April 12, 1945, less than three weeks before Hitler's suicide.As Kershaw shows, the structure of Hitler's "charismatic rule" created a powerful negative bond between him and the Nazi leadership- they had no future without him, and so their fates were inextricably tied. Terror also helped the Third Reich maintain its grip on power as the regime began to wage war not only on its ideologically defined enemies but also on the German people themselves. Yet even as each month brought fresh horrors for civilians, popular support for the regime remained linked to a patriotic support of Germany and a terrible fear of the enemy closing in.Based on prodigious new research, Kershaw's The End is a harrowing yet enthralling portrait of the Third Reich in its last desperate gasps.Show more"	"592"	"September 8, 2011"	"History; Nonfiction; World War II; War; Germany; Military History; Politics"	"Germany"	"Unknown"	"9781594203145"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11197125-the-end"
"The Third Reich in Power"	"The History of the Third Reich"	"Richard J. Evans"	"4.36"	"7,357"	"405"	"The definitive account of Germany's malign transformation under Hitler's total rule and the implacable march to war.By the middle of 1933, the democracy of the Weimar Republic had been transformed into the police state of the Third Reich, mobilized around the cult of the leader, Adolf Hitler. If this could happen in less than a year, what would the future hold? Only the most fervent Nazi party loyalists would have predicted how radical the transformation ahead would be.InThe Third Reich in Power, Richard J. Evans tells the story of Germany's radical reshaping under Nazi rule. Every area of life, from literature, culture, and the arts to religion, education, and science, was subordinated to the relentless drive to prepare Germany for war. His book shows how the Nazis attempted to penetrate and reorder every aspect of German society, encountering many kinds and degrees of resistance along the way but gradually winning the acceptance of the German people in the long run.Those who were seen as unfit to be counted among the German people were dealt with in increasingly brutal terms. The Nazi regime took more and more radical measures against the racially "unfit," including Germany's Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, mentally ill, "asocial" and "habitual" criminals. After six years of foreign policy brinkmanship that took the Nazi regime from success to success, Hitler's drive to prepare Germany for the war he saw as its destiny reached its fateful hour in September 1939. The war he unleashed was to plunge the world into a maelstrom of genocide and destruction. The Third Reich in Power is the fullest and most authoritative account yet written of how, in six years, Germany was brought to the edge of that terrible abyss.Show more"	"941"	"October 20, 2005"	"History; Nonfiction; World War II; Germany; Politics; War; European History"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781594200748"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/536788.The_Third_Reich_in_Power"
"Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris"	"Hitler"	"Ian Kershaw"	"4.16"	"6,819"	"276"	"From his illegitimate birth in a small Austrian village to his fiery death in a bunker under the Reich chancellery in Berlin, Adolf Hitler left a murky trail, strewn with contradictory tales & overgrown with self-created myths. One truth prevails: the sheer scale of the evils that he unleashed on the world has made him a demonic figure without equal in this century. Kershaw's Hitler brings us closer than ever before to the character of the bizarre misfit in his 30-year ascent from a Viennese shelter for the indigent to uncontested rule over the German nation that had tried & rejected democracy in the crippling aftermath of WWI. With extraordinary vividness, Kershaw recreates the settings that made Hitler's rise possible: the virulent anti-Semitism of prewar Vienna, the crucible of a war with immense casualties, the toxic nationalism that gripped Bavaria in the 20s, the undermining of the Weimar Republic by extremists of the Right & the Left, the hysteria that accompanied Hitler's seizure of power in 1933 & then mounted in brutal attacks by his storm troopers on Jews & others condemned as enemies of the Aryan race. In an account drawing on many previously untapped sources, Hitler metamorphoses from an obscure fantasist, a drummer sounding an insistent beat of hatred in Munich beer halls, to the instigator of an infamous failed putsch &, ultimately, to the leadership of a ragtag alliance of right-wing parties fused into a movement that enthralled the German people.

Evans"	"4.31"	"12,116"	"896"	"From one of the world's most distinguished historians, a magisterial new reckoning with Hitler's rise to power and the collapse of civilization in Nazi Germany.In 1900 Germany was the most progressive and dynamic nation in Europe, the only country whose rapid technological and social growth and change challenged that of the United States. Its political culture was less authoritarian than Russia's and less anti-Semitic than France's; representative institutions were thriving, and competing political parties and elections were a central part of life. How then can we explain the fact that in little more than a generation this stable modern country would be in the hands of a violent, racist, extremist political movement that would lead it and all of Europe into utter moral, physical, and cultural ruin?There is no story in twentieth-century history more important to understand, and Richard Evans has written the definitive account for our time. A masterful synthesis of a vast body of scholarly work integrated with important new research and interpretations, Evans's history restores drama and contingency to the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazis, even as he shows how ready Germany was by the early 1930s for such a takeover to occur. With many people angry and embittered by military defeat and economic ruin; a state undermined by a civil service, an army, and a law enforcement system deeply alienated from the democratic order introduced in 1918; beset by the growing extremism of voters prey to panic about the increasing popularity of communism; home to a tiny but quite successful Jewish community subject to widespread suspicion and resentment, Germany proved to be fertile ground for Nazism's ideology of hatred.The first book of what will ultimately be a complete three-volume history of Nazi Germany, The Coming of the Third Reich is a masterwork of the historian's art and the book by which all others on this subject will be judged.Show more"	"622"	"February 1, 2005"	"History; Nonfiction; World War II; Germany; Politics; War; European History"	"Unknown"	"Julius Streicher,Gregor Strasser,Otto von Bismarck,Erich Ludendorff,Paul von Hindenburg,Heinrich Brüning,Friedrich Ebert,Joseph Goebbels,Franz von Papen,Adolf Hitler,Heinrich Himmler,Hermann Ahlwardt,Alfred Hugenberg,Kurt von Schleicher,Hermann Göring,William II, German Emperor"	"9780143034698"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/319473.The_Coming_of_the_Third_Reich"

It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.Show more"	"374"	"October 18, 2006"	"Nonfiction; Religion; Science; Philosophy; Atheism; Audiobook; Psychology"	"Unknown"	"Aaron,Mother Teresa,Richard Dawkins,Sam Harris,Christopher Hitchens,Stephen Jay Gould,Douglas Adams,Johann Hari,Ted Haggard,Cecil Frances Alexander,Peter Singer,Natalie Angier,Achilles"	"9780618680009"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14743.The_God_Delusion"

Dennett"	"3.88"	"12,921"	"568"	"An innovative thinker tackles the controversial question of why we believe in God and how religion shapes our lives and our future.For a growing number of people, there is nothing more important than religion. It is an integral part of their marriage, child rearing, and community. In this daring new book, distinguished philosopher Daniel C. Dennett takes a hard look at this phenomenon and asks why. Where does our devotion to God come from and what purpose does it serve? Is religion a blind evolutionary compulsion or a rational choice? In "Breaking the Spell," Dennett argues that the time has come to shed the light of science on the fundamental questions of faith. In a spirited narrative that ranges widely through history, philosophy, and psychology, Dennett explores how organized religion evolved from folk beliefs and why it is such a potent force today. Deftly and lucidly, he contends that the "belief in belief" has fogged any attempt to rationally consider the existence of God and the relationship between divinity and human need."Breaking the Spell" is not an antireligious screed but rather an eyeopening exploration of the role that belief plays in our lives, our interactions, and our country. With the gulf between rationalists and adherents of "intelligent design" widening daily, Dennett has written a timely and provocative book that will be read and passionately debated by believers and nonbelievers alike.Show more"	"464"	"February 2, 2006"	"Religion; Philosophy; Nonfiction; Science; Atheism; Psychology; Evolution"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780670034727"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2067.Breaking_the_Spell"
"The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values"	"None"	"Sam Harris"	"3.90"	"24,233"	"1,371"	"Sam Harris' first book,The End of Faith, ignited a worldwide debate about the validity of religion. In the aftermath, Harris discovered that most people - from religious fundamentalists to non-believing scientists - agree on one point: science has nothing to say on the subject of human values. Indeed, our failure to address questions of meaning and morality through science has now become the most common justification for religious faith. It is also the primary reason why so many secularists and religious moderates feel obligated to "respect" the hardened superstitions of their more devout neighbors.In this explosive new book, Sam Harris tears down the wall between scientific facts and human values, arguing that most people are simply mistaken about the relationship between morality and the rest of human knowledge. Harris urges us to think about morality in terms of human and animal well-being, viewing the experiences of conscious creatures as peaks and valleys on a "moral landscape." Because there are definite facts to be known about where we fall on this landscape, Harris foresees a time when science will no longer limit itself to merely describing what people do in the name of "morality"; in principle, science should be able to tell us what weoughtto do to live the best lives possible.Bringing a fresh perspective to age-old questions of right and wrong and good and evil, Harris demonstrates that we already know enough about the human brain and its relationship to events in the world to say that there are right and wrong answers to the most pressing questions of human life. Because such answers exist, moral relativism is simply false - and comes at increasing cost to humanity. And the intrusions of religion into the sphere of human values can be finally repelled: for just as there is no such thing as Christian physics or Muslim algebra, there can be no Christian or Muslim morality.Using his expertise in philosophy and neuroscience, along with his experience on the front lines of our "culture wars," Harris delivers a game-changing book about the future of science and about the real basis of human cooperation.Show more"	"291"	"October 5, 2010"	"Philosophy; Nonfiction; Science; Religion; Psychology; Atheism; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781439171219"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7785194-the-moral-landscape"

As he would later write in the first of a series of award-winning columns for "Vanity Fair," he suddenly found himself being deported "from the country of the well across the stark frontier that marks off the land of malady." Over the next eighteen months, until his death in Houston on December 15, 2011, he wrote constantly and brilliantly on politics and culture, astonishing readers with his capacity for superior work even in extremis.Throughout the course of his ordeal battling esophageal cancer, Hitchens adamantly and bravely refused the solace of religion, preferring to confront death with both eyes open. In this account of his affliction, he describes the torments of illness, discusses its taboos, and explores how disease transforms experience and changes our relationship to the world around us. By turns personal and philosophical, Hitchens embraces the full panoply of human emotions as cancer invades his body and compels him to grapple with the enigma of mortality.Show more"	"104"	"September 4, 2012"	"Nonfiction; Philosophy; Memoir; Biography; Religion; Essays; Death"	"Unknown"	"Christopher Hitchens"	"9781455502752"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13529055-mortality"

"Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will"	"None"	"Robert M. Sapolsky"	"4.23"	"7,479"	"1,119"	"One of our great behavioral scientists, the bestselling author ofBehave, plumbs the depths of the science and philosophy of decision-making to mount a devastating case against free will, an argument with profound consequences.Robert Sapolsky'sBehave, his now classic account of why humans do good and why they do bad, pointed toward an unsettling conclusion: we may not grasp the precise marriage of nature and nurture that creates the physics and chemistry at base of human behavior, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Now, inDetermined, Sapolsky takes his argument all the way, mounting a brilliant (and in his inimitable way, delightful) full-frontal assault on the pleasant fantasy that there's some separate self telling our biology what to do.Determinedoffers a marvelous synthesis of what we know about how consciousness works--the tight weave between reason and emotion, and between stimulus and response, in the moment and over a life. One by one, Sapolsky tackles all the major arguments for free will and takes them out, cutting a path through the thickets of chaos and complexity science and quantum physics, as well as touching ground on some of the wilder shores of philosophy. He shows us that the history of medicine is in no small part the history of learning that fewer and fewer things are somebody's "fault"; for example, for centuries we thought seizures were a sign of demonic possession. Yet as he acknowledges, it's very hard, and at times impossible, to uncouple from our zeal to judge others, and to judge ourselves. Sapolsky applies the new understanding of life beyond free will to some of our most essential questions around punishment, morality, and living well together.By the end, Sapolsky argues that while living our daily lives recognizing that we have no free will is going to be monumentally difficult, doing so is not going to result in anarchy, pointlessness and existential malaise. Instead, it will make for a much more humane world.Show more"	"528"	"October 17, 2023"	"Science; Philosophy; Nonfiction; Psychology; Neuroscience; Biology; Audiobook"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780525560975"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83817782-determined"

Hailed in Le Point as a “masterpiece of simplicity, emotion and elegance,” it is the story of an intense friendship between “the Narrator” and his close childhood friend, Fanny, who suffers from profound psychological disorders. A series of short scenes paints the portrait of a strong-willed and tormented young woman battling many demons, and of the narrator’s loving and anguished attachment to her. Anne Serre poignantly depicts the bewildering back and forth between hope and despair involved in such a relationship, while playfully calling into question the very form of the novel.

Anderson bring us the magnificent final chapter in the unforgettable saga begun inDune: House Atreidesand continued inDune: House Harkonnen.Here nobles and commoners, soldiers and slaves, wives and courtesans shape the amazing destiny of a tumultuous universe. An epic saga of love and war, crime and politics, religion and revolution, this magnificent novel is a fitting conclusion to a great science fiction trilogy ... and an invaluable addition to the thrilling world of Frank Herbert's immortalDune.Dune: House CorrinoFearful of losing his precarious hold on the Golden Lion Throne, Shaddam IV, Emperor of a Million Worlds, has devised a radical scheme to develop an alternative to melange, the addictive spice that binds the Imperium together and that can be found only on the desert world of Dune.In subterranean labs on the machine planet Ix, cruel Tleilaxu overlords use slaves and prisoners as part of a horrific plan to manufacture a synthetic form of melange known as amal. If amal can supplant the spice from Dune, it will give Shaddam what he seeks: absolute power.But Duke Leto Atreides, grief-stricken yet unbowed by the tragic death of his son Victor, determined to restore the honor and prestige of his House, has his own plans for Ix.He will free the Ixians from their oppressive conquerors and restore his friend Prince Rhombur, injured scion of the disgraced House Vernius, to his rightful place as Ixian ruler. It is a bold and risky venture, for House Atreides has limited military resources and many ruthless enemies, including the sadistic Baron Harkonnen, despotic master of Dune.Meanwhile, Duke Leto's consort, the beautiful Lady Jessica, obeying the orders of her superiors in the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, has conceived a child that the Sisterhood intends to be the penultimate step in the creation of an all-powerful being. Yet what the Sisterhood doesn't know is that the child Jessica is carrying is not the girl they are expecting, but a boy.Jessica's act of disobedience is an act of love -- her attempt to provide her Duke with a male heir to House Atreides -- but an act that, when discovered, could kill both mother and baby.Like the Bene Gesserit, Shaddam Corrino is also concerned with making a plan for the future -- securing his legacy. Blinded by his need for power, the Emperor will launch a plot against Dune, the only natural source of true spice. If he succeeds, his madness will result in a cataclysmic tragedy not even he foresees: the end of space travel, the Imperium, and civilization itself.With Duke Leto and other renegades and revolutionaries fighting to stem the tide of darkness that threatens to engulf their universe, the stage is set for a showdown unlike any seen before.Show more"	"667"	"August 27, 2002"	"Science Fiction; Fiction; Fantasy; Science Fiction Fantasy; Audiobook; Space Opera; Ebooks"	"Unknown"	"Anirul,Hasimir Fenring,Leto Atreides,Rhombur Vernius,Yohsa,Dominic Vernius,Chamberlain Ridondo,Calimar,Dr. Yueh,Lady Jessica,Shaddam IV"	"9780553580334"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20252.House_Corrino"

Even though she survived, that single instant of teenage madness made Providence a felon and irrevocably altered her life. When her mother disappears years later under suspicious circumstances, Providence tells herself that returning home is her chance to find closure after a prolonged estrangement from her family. Never mind that this is only half of the truth: she’s also returning to finally confront her abusive father, Tom Byrd. Nothing can stamp out Providence’s certainty that he is guilty of whatever terrible thing has happened to her mother.As the search unfolds, Providence is haunted by the wounds of her past, none of which cut as deep as the distance between her and her younger sisters. Harmony and Grace are both uniquely scarred by her attempted matricide, and both have their own idea of what reconciliations might look like – if reconciling is even possible. Harmony urges Providence to make their father pay for his sins; Grace begs her to end the cycle of violence that has haunted their family for generations. As her thirst for vengeance collides with her desire to heal her relationships with her sisters, Providence must decide which she values more: revenge or redemption.Sharp and poignant, Every Sweet Thing Is Bitter is a stunning novel that eschews picture-perfect endings and dares to tell a story about a resilient queer woman and her relentless determination to persevere.Show more"	"320"	"April 22, 2025"	"Mystery; Fiction; Thriller; Mystery Thriller; Audiobook; LGBT; Contemporary"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9798892422369"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219401057-every-sweet-thing-is-bitter"
"The Man No One Believed: The Untold Story of the Georgia Church Murders"	"None"	"Joshua Sharpe"	"3.50"	"4,621"	"577"	"“Only very rarely does one of our stories—one of us—change the course of human events. Joshua Sharpe asked the right questions, refusing easy answers.” —Anna Quindlen, Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and best-selling authorThe riveting story of a 1985 double murder, a long-overdue investigation, and the fight to exonerate an innocent man.In 1985, a white man walked into a South Georgia church and brutally murdered Harold and Thelma Swain, two pillars of the area’s Black community. The killer vanished into the night. For fifteen years, the case remained unsolved. Then authorities zeroed in on Dennis Perry, a carpenter who grew up nearby. Convicted with devastatingly flawed evidence, Perry received a double life sentence.When award-winning journalist and South Georgia native Joshua Sharpe retraces the case, he discovers a winding path of corruption, devastating missteps, and secrets. Driven by the pursuit of the truth, Sharpe’s investigation takes him through dusty courthouse archives, down winding dirt roads, and into intense interviews. But he keeps knocking on doors—even after they’re slammed in his face. Sharpe uncovers explosive evidence that helps prove Dennis Perry’s innocence. And he confronts a long-ignored suspect: an alleged white supremacist who had bragged about committing the murders.But the fight for the truth is not easily won. When a key figure in the investigation turns up dead under suspicious circumstances, Sharpe’s sources and editors insist that he could be in danger. And even as evidence mounts of Perry’s innocence, local officials work to keep him in prison—until Sharpe’s reporting forces the state to launch a new investigation—thirty-five years after the Swains’ murders. Driven by Sharpe’s tireless reporting,The Man No One Believedtells the unbelievable story of one of the most confounding cases in Georgia history, the extraordinary fight to free an innocent man, and how state officials worked against the odds to deliver justice for the Swains after all.Both a riveting true crime story and a searing indictment of American injustice,The Man No One Believedis a gripping work of literary journalism—a moving examination of how we reckon with the sins of our past.Show more"	"272"	"August 5, 2025"	"True Crime; Nonfiction; History; Crime; Audiobook; Thriller; Adult"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781324020714"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218569892-the-man-no-one-believed"

Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.Show more"	"475"	"November 16, 2010"	"Nonfiction; History; Biography; Book Club; World War II; War; Historical"	"Unknown"	"Louie Zamperini,Russell Allen Phillips,Pete Zamperini,Stanley Pillsbury,Harry Brooks,Payton Jordan,Anthony Zamperini,Louise Zamperini,Francis McNamara (Mac),William Harris,Fred Garrett,Frank Tinker,Thorbjørn Christiansen,Sylvia Zamperini Flammer,Virginia Zamperini,Lynn Moody,Cecy Perry,Cynthia Zamperini (Applewhite),Harry Read,Yukichi Kano"	"9781400064168"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8664353-unbroken"

With a team composed of the sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the University of Washington’s eight-oar crew team was never expected to defeat the elite teams of the East Coast and Great Britain, yet they did, going on to shock the world by defeating the German team rowing for Adolf Hitler. The emotional heart of the tale lies with Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not only to regain his shattered self-regard but also to find a real place for himself in the world.

But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail. Three men changed Seabiscuit’s fortunes:Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire. When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious mustang breaker from the Colorado plains. Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo Emerson. Over four years, these unlikely partners survived a phenomenal run of bad fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a neurotic, pathologically indolent also-ran into an American sports icon.Author Laura Hillenbrand brilliantly re-creates a universal underdog story, one that proves life is a horse race.From the Hardcover edition.Show more"	"457"	"July 1, 2003"	"Nonfiction; History; Biography; Sports; Animals; Horses; Book Club"	"The United States of America"	"Unknown"	"9780345465085"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/110737.Seabiscuit"

"The Horse God Built"	"None"	"Lawrence Scanlan"	"4.20"	"2,551"	"184"	"He was the perfect horse, it was said . . . "the horse God built."Most of us know the legend of Secretariat, the tall, handsome chestnut racehorse whose string of honors runs long and rich: the only two-year-old ever to win Horse of the Year, in 1972; winner in 1973 of the Triple Crown, his times in all three races still unsurpassed; featured on the cover ofTime, Newsweek,andSports Illustrated;the only horse listed on ESPN's top fifty athletes of the twentieth century (ahead of Mickey Mantle). His final race at Toronto's Woodbine Racetrack is a touchstone memory for horse lovers everywhere. Yet while Secretariat will be remembered forever, one man, Eddie "Shorty" Sweat, who was pivotal to the great horse's success, has been all but forgotten---until now.InThe Horse God Built,bestselling equestrian writer Lawrence Scanlan has written a tribute to an exceptional man that is also a backroads journey to a corner of the racing world rarely visited. As a young black man growing up in South Carolina, Eddie Sweat struggled at several occupations before settling on the job he was born for---groom to North America's finest racehorses. As Secretariat's groom, loyal friend, and protector, Eddie understood the horse far better than anyone else. A wildly generous man who could read a horse with his eyes, he shared in little of the financial success or glamour of Secretariat's wins on the track, but won the heart of Big Red with his soft words and relentless devotion.In Scanlan's rich narrative, we get a groom's-eye view of the racing world and the vantage of a man who spent every possible moment with the horse he loved, yet who often basked in the horse's glory from the sidelines. More than anything else,The Horse God Builtis a moving portrait of the powerful bond between human and horse.Show more"	"335"	"May 1, 2007"	"Horses; Nonfiction; Sports; Animals; History; Horse Racing; Biography"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9780312367244"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/714968.The_Horse_God_Built"
"The Eighty-Dollar Champion: Snowman, the Horse That Inspired a Nation"	"None"	"Elizabeth Letts"	"4.23"	"14,684"	"1,991"	"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERNovember 1958: the National Horse Show at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Into the rarefied atmosphere of wealth and tradition comes the most unlikely of horses—a drab white former plow horse named Snowman—and his rider, Harry de Leyer. They were the longest of all longshots—and their win was the stuff of legend.Harry de Leyer first saw the horse he would name Snowman on a bleak winter afternoon between the slats of a rickety truck bound for the slaughterhouse. He recognized the spark in the eye of the beaten-up horse and bought him for eighty dollars. On Harry’s modest farm on Long Island, the horse thrived. But the recent Dutch immigrant and his growing family needed money, and Harry was always on the lookout for the perfect thoroughbred to train for the show-jumping circuit—so he reluctantly sold Snowman to a farm a few miles down the road.But Snowman had other ideas about what Harry needed. When he turned up back at Harry’s barn, dragging an old tire and a broken fence board, Harry knew that he had misjudged the horse. And so he set about teaching this shaggy, easygoing horse how to fly. One show at a time, against extraordinary odds and some of the most expensive thoroughbreds alive, the pair climbed to the very top of the sport of show jumping.Here is the dramatic and inspiring rise to stardom of an unlikely duo, based on the insight and recollections of “the Flying Dutchman” himself. Their story captured the heart of Cold War–era America—a story of unstoppable hope, inconceivable dreams, and the chance to have it all. Elizabeth Letts’s message is Never give up, even when the obstacles seem sky-high. There is something extraordinary in all of us.Show more"	"329"	"August 23, 2011"	"Nonfiction; Horses; Animals; Biography; History; Sports; Audiobook"	"Long Island, New York(United States)"	"Unknown"	"9780345521088"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10340846-the-eighty-dollar-champion"

Mario, the son of Mama and Papa Bellini, proprietors of the subway-station newsstand, had only heard the sound once. What was this new, strangely musical chirping? None other than the mellifluous leg-rubbing of the somewhat disoriented Chester Cricket from Connecticut. Attracted by the irresistible smell of liverwurst, Chester had foolishly jumped into the picnic basket of some unsuspecting New Yorkers on a junket to the country. Despite the insect's wurst intentions, he ends up in a pile of dirt in Times Square.Mario is elated to find Chester. He begs his parents to let him keep the shiny insect in the newsstand, assuring his bug-fearing mother that crickets are harmless, maybe even good luck. What ensues is an altogether captivating spin on the city mouse/country mouse story, as Chester adjusts to the bustle of the big city. Despite the cricket's comfortable matchbox bed (with Kleenex sheets); the fancy, seven-tiered pagoda cricket cage from Sai Fong's novelty shop; tasty mulberry leaves; the jolly company of Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat; and even his new-found fame as "the most famous musician in New York City," Chester begins to miss his peaceful life in the Connecticut countryside.The Cricket in Times Square--a Newbery Honor Book in 1961--is charmingly illustrated by the well-loved Garth Williams, and the tiniest details of this elegantly spun, vividly told, surprisingly suspenseful tale will stick with children for years and years.

He shows how Leonardo's genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation, and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy. He produced the two most famous paintings in history, The Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. But in his own mind, he was just as much a man of science and technology. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of Vitruvian Man, made him history's most creative geniusShow more"	"600"	"October 17, 2017"	"Biography; Nonfiction; History; Art; Audiobook; Science; Biography Memoir"	"Unknown"	"Leonardo da Vinci"	"9781501139154"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci"

Janson"	"3.78"	"39,221"	"191"	"For 1000s of art lovers both amateur & professional, esthetic life began with Janson, as his History of Art is often called. In the 1st edition, published in 1962, he spoke to that perennial reader he gently called "the troubled layman." His opening paragraph revealed his sympathy: "Why is this supposed to be art?" he quoted rhetorically. "How often have we heard this question asked--or asked it ourselves, perhaps--in front of one of the strange, disquieting works that we are likely to find nowadays in the museum or art exhibition?" Keeping that curious, questioning perspective in mind, he wrote a history of art from cave painting to Picasso that was singularly welcoming, illuminating & exciting. Sojourning thru this book, a reader is offered every amenity for a comfortable trip. Because he never assumes knowledge on the part of the reader, a recent immigrant from Mars could comprehend Western art from this text. The only assumption the Jansons have made is that with a little guidance everyone can come to understand the artifacts that centuries of architecture, sculpture, design & painting have deposited in our paths.

Escher was born in 1898 in Leeuwarden (Netherlands). He received his first drawing lessons during secondary school from F.W. van der Haagen, who also taught him the block printing, thus fostering Escher's innate graphic talents.From 1912 to 1922 he studied at the School of Architecture and Ornamental Design in Haarlem, where he was instructed in graphic techniques by S. Jessurun de Mesquita, who greatly influenced Escher's further artistic development. Between 1922 and 1934 the artist lived and worked in Italy. Afterwards Escher spent two years in Switzerland and five in Brussels before finally moving back to Barn in Holland, where he died in 1972.M.C. Escher is not a surrealist drawing us into his dream world, but an architect of perfectly impossible worlds who presents the structurally unthinkable as though it were a law of nature. The resulting dimensional and perspectival illusions bring us into confrontation with the limitations of our sensory perception.About the Series:Each book in TASCHEN's Basic Art series features:a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance a concise biography approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captionsShow more"	"92"	"February 1, 2001"	"Art; Nonfiction; Design; Reference; Art History; Biography; Art Design"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9783822858646"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276287.M_C_Escher"

In your print Reptiles you have given such a striking illustration of reincarnation.’ I replied, ‘Madame, if that’s the way you see it, so be it.’” An engagingly sly comment by the renowned Dutch graphic artist Maurits Cornelis Escher (1898–1972)―the complex ambiguities of whose work leave hasty or single-minded interpretations far behind. Long before the first computer-generated 3-D images were thrilling the public, Escher was a master of the third dimension. His lithograph Magic Mirror dates as far back as 1946. In taking that title for this book, mathematician Bruno Ernst is stressing the magic spell Escher’s work invariably casts on those who see it. Ernst visited Escher every week for a year, systematically talking through his entire œuvre with him. Their discussions resulted in a friendship that gave Ernst intimate access to the life and conceptual world of Escher. Ernst’s account was meticulously scrutinized and made accurate by the artist himself. Escher’s work refuses to be pigeonholed. Scientific, psychological, or aesthetic criteria alone cannot do it justice. The questions remain. Why did he create the pictures? How did he construct them? What preliminary studies were necessary before achieving the final version? And how are the various images Escher created interrelated? This book, complete with biographical data, 250 illustrations, and explications of mathematical problems, offers answers to these and many other questions, and is an authentic source text of the first order.Show more"	"116"	"February 26, 2007"	"Art; Nonfiction; Biography; Reference; Art History; Design; Mathematics"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9783822837030"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276289.The_Magic_Mirror_of_M_C_Escher"

Her depictions of a happily unmarried retail worker inConvenience Store Womanand a young woman convinced she is an alien inEarthlingshave endeared her to millions of readers worldwide.Vanishing Worldtakes Murata’s universe to a bold new level, imagining an alternative Japan where attitudes to sex and procreation are wildly different to our own.As a girl, Amane realizes with horror that her parents “copulated” in order to bring her into the world, rather than using artificial insemination, which became the norm in the mid-twentieth century. Amane strives to get away from what she considers an indoctrination in this strange “system” by her mother, but her infatuations with both anime characters and real people have a sexual force that is undeniable. As an adult in an appropriately sexless marriage—sex between married couples is now considered as taboo as incest—Amane and her husband Saku decide to go and live in a mysterious new town called Experiment City or Paradise-Eden, where all children are raised communally, and every person is considered a Mother to all children. Men are beginning to become pregnant using artificial wombs that sit outside of their bodies like balloons, and children are nameless, called only “Kodomo-chan.” Is this the new world that will purify Amane of her strangeness once and for all?Show more"	"240"	"April 15, 2025"	"Fiction; Science Fiction; Japan; Dystopia; Japanese Literature; Literary Fiction; Audiobook"	"Japan"	"Unknown"	"9780802164667"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219300660-vanishing-world"

He’s entangled in a sexual relationship with a married man, and while he has built a chosen family in Japan, he is estranged from his family in Houston, particularly his mother, whose preference for the son’s oft-troubled homophobic brother, Chris, pushed him to leave home.

But as they sail to their final destination in the Chukchi Sea, where their captain Arnold Lovejoy has an urgent directive of his own to attend to, their encounters with the natural world become more brutal, harrowing, ghostly, and strange.With one foot firmly planted in the traditional sea-voyage narrative, and another in a blazing mythos of its own, this debut novel looks unsparingly at the cost of environmental exploitation and predation, and in doing so feverishly sings not only of the past, but to the present and future as well.Show more"	"386"	"March 11, 2025"	"Fiction; Historical Fiction; Fantasy; Horror; Literary Fiction; Historical; Contemporary"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9781646053582"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205668518-north-sun"
"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America"	"None"	"Erik Larson"	"4.00"	"751,886"	"44,483"	"Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that 'The Devil in the White City' is not, in fact, a highly imaginative novel. Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor.Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous "White City" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison.The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims.Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. - John MoeShow more"	"464"	"February 11, 2003"	"Nonfiction; History; True Crime; Book Club; Crime; Historical; Mystery"	"Chicago, Illinois(United States),Illinois(United States)"	"Daniel Burnham,H.H.

"1776"	"None"	"David McCullough"	"4.10"	"246,566"	"9,233"	"In this masterful book, David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence - when the whole American cause was riding on their success, without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, 1776 is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington, who had never before led an army in battle.

With a breadth and depth matched by no other one-volume life, he carries the reader through Washington's troubled boyhood, his precocious feats in the French and Indian Wars, his creation of Mount Vernon, his heroic exploits with the Continental Army, his presiding over the Constitutional Convention and his magnificent performance as America's first president.Despite the reverence his name inspires Washington remains a waxwork to many readers, worthy but dull, a laconic man of remarkable self-control. But in this groundbreaking work Chernow revises forever the uninspiring stereotype. He portrays Washington as a strapping, celebrated horseman, elegant dancer and tireless hunter, who guarded his emotional life with intriguing ferocity. Not only did Washington gather around himself the foremost figures of the age, including James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, he orchestrated their actions to help realise his vision for the new federal government, define the separation of powers, and establish the office of the presidency.Ron Chernow takes us on a page-turning journey through all the formative events of America's founding.

"Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power"	"None"	"Jon Meacham"	"4.05"	"42,891"	"2,488"	"In this magnificent biography, the Pulitzer Prize–winning author ofAmerican LionandFranklin and Winstonbrings vividly to life an extraordinary man and his remarkable times.Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Powergives us Jefferson the politician and president, a great and complex human being forever engaged in the wars of his era. Philosophers think; politicians maneuver. Jefferson’s genius was that he was both and could do both, often simultaneously. Such is the art of power.Thomas Jefferson hated confrontation, and yet his understanding of power and of human nature enabled him to move men and to marshal ideas, to learn from his mistakes, and to prevail. Passionate about many things—women, his family, books, science, architecture, gardens, friends, Monticello, and Paris—Jefferson loved America most, and he strove over and over again, despite fierce opposition, to realize his vision: the creation, survival, and success of popular government in America. Jon Meacham lets us see Jefferson’s world as Jefferson himself saw it, and to appreciate how Jefferson found the means to endure and win in the face of rife partisan division, economic uncertainty, and external threat. Drawing on archives in the United States, England, and France, as well as unpublished Jefferson presidential papers, Meacham presents Jefferson as the most successful political leader of the early republic, and perhaps in all of American history.The father of the ideal of individual liberty, of the Louisiana Purchase, of the Lewis and Clark expedition, and of the settling of the West, Jefferson recognized that the genius of humanity—and the genius of the new nation—lay in the possibility of progress, of discovering the undiscovered and seeking the unknown. From the writing of the Declaration of Independence to elegant dinners in Paris and in the President’s House; from political maneuverings in the boardinghouses and legislative halls of Philadelphia and New York to the infant capital on the Potomac; from his complicated life at Monticello, his breathtaking house and plantation in Virginia, to the creation of the University of Virginia, Jefferson was central to the age. Here too is the personal Jefferson, a man of appetite, sensuality, and passion.The Jefferson story resonates today not least because he led his nation through ferocious partisanship and cultural warfare amid economic change and external threats, and also because he embodies an eternal drama, the struggle of the leadership of a nation to achieve greatness in a difficult and confounding world.Show more"	"802"	"November 13, 2012"	"History; Biography; Nonfiction; Presidents; American History; Politics; Biography Memoir"	"The United States of America,Monticello, Virginia(United States),Virginia(United States)"	"Thomas Jefferson"	"Unknown"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41021344-thomas-jefferson"
"James Monroe: A Life"	"None"	"Tim  McGrath"	"4.23"	"1,373"	"168"	"The extraordinary life of James Monroe: soldier, senator, diplomat, and the last Founding Father to hold the presidency, a man who helped transform thirteen colonies into a vibrant and mighty republic.Monroe lived a life defined by revolutions. From the battlefields of the War for Independence, to his ambassadorship to France in the days of the guillotine, to his own role in the creation of Congress's partisan divide, he was a man who embodied the restless spirit of the age. He was never one to back down from a fight, whether it be with Alexander Hamilton, with whom he nearly engaged in a duel (prevented, ironically, by Aaron Burr), or George Washington, his hero turned political opponent. When the British sacked the capital in 1814, it was Monroe, by now secretary of state, who rallied troops and volunteers to America's defense, reliving old glories. Yet even in temperament, he was capable of radical change, as displayed when he was elected the fifth president of the United States. The last of his generation to wield such power, this fiercest of partisans instead sought to bridge divisions and sow unity, calming turbulent political seas and inheriting Washington's mantle of placing country above party. Over his two terms, he transformed the United States, strengthening American power both at home and abroad.Critically acclaimed author Tim McGrath has delved into an astonishing array of primary sources, many rarely seen since Monroe's own time, to conjure up this remarkable portrait of an essential American statesman and president.Show more"	"738"	"May 5, 2020"	"Biography; Presidents; History; American History; Nonfiction; Us Presidents; Politics"	"Unknown"	"James Monroe"	"9780451477262"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52354569-james-monroe"
"John Quincy Adams: Militant Spirit"	"None"	"James Traub"	"4.39"	"1,660"	"235"	"John Quincy Adams was the last of his kind—a Puritan from the age of the Founders who despised party and compromise, yet dedicated himself to politics and government. The son of John Adams, he was a brilliant ambassador and secretary of state, a frustrated president at a historic turning point in American politics, and a dedicated congressman for eighteen years who collapsed on the floor of the House of Representatives in the midst of an impassioned political debate. He died two days later at the age of 80.InJohn Quincy Adams, scholar and journalist James Traub draws on Adams’ diary, letters, and writings to evoke a diplomat and president whose ideas remain with us today. Adams was a fierce nationalist who, as secretary of state, championed the idea of American expansion. Yet, at the same time he warned against moralistic and militaristic policies abroad—a chastening wisdom that makes him the father of what we now call “realism” in foreign policy. As president, he was a bold proponent of the idea of activist government later brought to fruition by Abraham Lincoln and others.Adams’ numerous achievements—and equally numerous failures—stand as testaments to his unwavering moral convictions. A man who refused to take refuge in the politically prudent course of action, Adams was repudiated by his own Federalist party and, as president, by the nation that voted him out of office. And yet, in the final decade of his life, Adams regained the country’s regard, and even reverence, for as a congressman he often stood alone against the forces of slavery, twice beating back motions of censure.John Quincy Adamstells the story of this brilliant, flinty, and unyielding man whose life exemplified political courage—a life against which each of us might measure our own.Show more"	"640"	"March 22, 2016"	"Biography; History; Presidents; Nonfiction; American History; Us Presidents; Politics"	"Unknown"	"John Quincy Adams"	"9780465028276"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26240788-john-quincy-adams"
"American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House"	"None"	"Jon Meacham"	"3.86"	"56,606"	"2,251"	"The definitive biography of a larger-than-life president who defied norms, divided a nation, and changed Washington foreverAndrew Jackson, his intimate circle of friends, and his tumultuous times are at the heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern presidency. Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jackson's election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson's presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human drama-the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers- that shaped Jackson's private world through years of storm and victory.One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will- or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White House-from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman-have found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision.Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe-no matter what it took.Show more"	"483"	"November 11, 2008"	"History; Biography; Nonfiction; Presidents; American History; Politics; Us Presidents"	"The United States of America"	"John Quincy Adams,Daniel Webster,Andrew Jackson,John C.

Based on a true incident, Their Pavel investigates the troubled social relations of a Moravian village that is endowed with the right of local governance but steeped in the habits of its feudalrelationship to the local barony. The novel explores the parallel fates of the children of a hanged murderer and thief. Milada, the appealing and alert daughter, is adopted on a whim by the aging baroness, while Pavel, the awkwardand taciturn son, is thrown upon the uncertain mercy of the village, but both suffer the stigma of their father's crime. In her sometimes grimly humorous picture of village life, the author spares neither the Catholic Church northe landed aristocracy nor the villagers themselves.Lynne Tatlock is Hortense and Tobias Lewin Distinguished Professor in the Humanities in the Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures at Washington Universityin St. Louis.Show more"	"Paperback"	"January 1, 1985"	"Classics; Fiction; German Literature; 19th Century; School; Read For School; Literature"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"9783150080566"	"German"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1954322.Das_Gemeindekind_Roman_"

It follows Parzival from his boyhood and career as a knight in the court of King Arthur to his ultimate achievement as King of the Temple of the Grail, which Wolfram describes as a life-giving Stone. As a knight serving the German nobility in the imperial Hohenstauffen period, the author was uniquely placed to describe the zest and colour of his hero's world, with dazzling depictions of courtly luxury, jousting and adventure. Yet this is not simply a tale of chivalry, but an epic quest for spiritual education, as Parzival must conquer his ignorance and pride and learn humility before he can finally win the Holy Grail.Show more"	"448"	"November 20, 1980"	"Classics; Medieval; Fiction; Arthurian; Poetry; German Literature; Literature"	"Unknown"	"Parzival"	"9780140443615"	"English"	"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/560089.Parzival"
