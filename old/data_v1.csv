Peter Jackson's "fierce, imaginative movie takes high-flying risks and inspires with its power and scale," wrote Newsweek. "In every way this is moviemaking on a grand scale," wrote the San Francisco Chronicle, while Time proclaimed the "grandeur, moral heft and emotional depth" of the film, which received thirteen Academy Award(R) nominations. Including more than 300 photographs from all three films, most unique to this book, and exclusive interviews with all the cast and crew, Brian Sibley's fascinating book takes every fan inside the process of adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork for the screen. For the first time in history, three major movies were made at the same time, a triumphant and monumental undertaking that took the world by storm. Here can be found details about the hundreds of dedicated artists, craftspeople and cast and crew members who labored for years -- adding authenticity at every stage -- to bring one of the greatest stories ever told to an eager film audience. Sibley takes us inside the process of filmmaking to show us how the magic is made -- from the director, writers and actors to wardrobe, makeup, miniatures, music and digital special effects, it's all here."It was tiring, physically and mentally, but never dull. Three movies, one big story, and so much variety: one day shooting scenes of intimate heart-wrenching drama, the next, vast battle scenes involving hundreds of extras.

Rowling, a successful writer of previous four books about a young wizard that enchanted the hearts of both the young and the grown-ups. Maybe the most important thing about this sequel is that it is the longest book of all seven, with its thirty-eight chapters and more than seven hundred pages (total number of pages varies according to the country; Swedish has, for example a thousand pages while UK version has seven hundred sixty six).Similar to the last four books, this one also revolves around young wizard named Harry Potter, his life in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his coming of age, relationship with his friends Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, but difference is that this book revolves more around Harry’s relationship with his godfather Sirius Black, introduced in the third book- Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.Also, the fifth book is somewhat more ‘mature’ and more ‘sinister’, because here readers learn that lord Voldemort (evil sorcerer and the nemesis of Harry) has indeed returned, along with his followers called ‘’Death Eaters’’ and that he has taken physical form and that the events that will happen because of their actions will be the core of the story.Click the Buy Now With One Click Button, and learn everything about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix .Harry potter and the order of phoenix, harry potter book 5, harry potter series kindle edition book 1-7, harry potter kindle free series, harry potter and the order of phoenix freeShow more","28","July 4, 2015","Fantasy; Harry Potter","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25857197-harry-potter-and-the-order-of-phoenix"

But one day, death announces itself to him, and to his shocked surprise, he is brought face to face with his own mortality.How, Tolstoy asks, does an unreflective man confront his one and only moment of truth?This short novel was an artistic culmination of a profound spiritual crisis in Tolstoy's life, a nine-year period following the publication of Anna Karenina during which he wrote not a word of fiction.A thoroughly absorbing, and, at times, terrifying glimpse into the abyss of death, it is also a strong testament to the possibility of finding spiritual salvation.Show more","86","January 1, 1886","Classics; Fiction; Russia; Russian Literature; Literature; Philosophy; Short Stories","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18386.The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilych"

The unstated objective of his lecture (“Existentialism Is a Humanism”) was to expound his philosophy as a form of “existentialism,” a term much bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was essentially a doctrine for philosophers, though, ironically, he was about to make it accessible to a general audience. The published text of his lecture quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre an international celebrity.The idea of freedom occupies the center of Sartre’s doctrine. Man, born into an empty, godless universe, is nothing to begin with. He creates his essence—his self, his being—through the choices he freely makes (“existence precedes essence”). Were it not for the contingency of his death, he would never end. Choosing to be this or that is to affirm the value of what we choose. In choosing, therefore, we commit not only ourselves but all of mankind.This book presents a new English translation of Sartre’s 1945 lecture and his analysis of Camus’sThe Stranger, along with a discussion of these works by acclaimed Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal.

Abraham had a choice to complete the task or to forget it. He resigned himself to the loss of his son, acting according to his faith. In other words, one must be willing to give up all his or her earthly possessions in infinite resignation and must also be willing to give up whatever it is that he or she loves more than God. Abraham had passed the test -- his love for God proved greater than anything else in him. And because a good and just Creator would not want a father to kill his son, God intervened at the last moment to prevent the sacrifice.Show more","152","October 16, 1843","Philosophy; Nonfiction; Religion; Classics; Theology; Christianity; Psychology","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24965.Fear_and_Trembling"

Nietzsche rewrites the former as a history of cruelty, exposing the central values of the Judaeo-Christian and liberal traditions - compassion, equality, justice - as the product of a brutal process of conditioning designed to domesticate the animal vitality of earlier cultures. The result is a book which raises profoundly disquieting issues about the violence of both ethics and interpretation. Nietzsche questions moral certainties by showing that religion and science have no claim to absolute truth, before turning on his own arguments in order to call their very presuppositions into question. The Genealogy is the most sustained of Nietzsche's later works and offers one of the fullest expressions of his characteristic concerns.

A myriad of topics are discussed, and explained in such a harmoniously complex way that the method has been termed Hegelian dialectic.

Stein develops the cartographical metaphor of the title by beginning with the "surface" (ego) of the psyche and exploring successively more complex areas, including complexes, libido thoery, shadow, "anima/us," the self, individuation, and synchronicity. The map soon resembles the multidisciplinary chart of a solar system more than it does a flat map. In each subject area, Stein draws heavily on papers that Jung wrote late in his life, but he sets these in the context of Jung's earlier developing thought. This method allows the author to demonstrate the interconnectedness and coherence of Jung's mature work. -- Choice, 10/15/98Stein could just as aptly have named his introductory guide "Jung's Art of the Soul," for the course the founder of analytical psychology charted also has the intuitive sweep of an artist on an inner journey integrated within a systematic framework of techniques. Though acknowledging Jung's creative, intuitive approach to fathoming the mysteries of the individual and collective human psyche, the author presents a solid case for the basic coherency and empirical underpinnings of the great psychoanalyst's theory-counter to those who viewed him as more of a mystic or philosopher who espoused: "As within, so without." Territory consciously omitted from this psychic map concern his analytic practice and interpretation of culture, history, and religion. Organized like a graduate thesis, all the major concepts that evolved over Jung's lengthy career are lucidly summarized with some contextual details: ego-consciousness, complexes, libido theory, archetypes, persona/shadow, anima/animus, the self, individuation, and synchronicity. While this presentation is eminently more accessible than most Jungian texts-and Stein does preface it with personal remarks about his long-time attraction to Jung-those who seek a sense of Jung's own voice and personal development in his quest for answers to many of life's enigmas will have their appetites whet to explore further. -- From Independent PublisherShow more","192","March 1, 1998","Psychology; Nonfiction; Philosophy; Spirituality; Science; Self Help; Psychoanalysis","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233234.Jung_s_Map_of_the_Soul"

It proved to be the turning point in Davis’s career, and the inspiration for him to change his mindset, his playing, and his life. At the time, Davis was a young, talented player who had been drafted by the 49ers in 2006 at number six, one of the highest draft positions for a tight end in NFL history. He played ten years for the team, which included a 2013 Super Bowl loss to the Baltimore Ravens in a 34-31 heartbreaker, where he recorded six catches for 104 yards. Winning a Super Bowl in 2016 with Peyton Manning, Davis landed a crucial downfield block and sprung teammate C.L. Anderson for a key 34-yard run that helped the Broncos defeat the Carolina Panthers 24-10. Davis retired in 2019 after a final four years playing pro for his hometown team in Washington. He’s now deeply involved in his new acting and producing feature films. Here he rewinds the tape to reflect on his career and competitive spirit—and the insights about teamwork, leadership, and responsibility that came in the aftermath of Coach Singletary’s press conference, spurring him to transform his life for the better. Weaving personal reflections with frank, real-world advice, Playing Ball is not just one athlete’s memoir but an eye-opening exploration of what winning—on the field and beyond—really means.Show more","240","August 20, 2024","Nonfiction; Biography Memoir; Biography; Memoir; Inspirational; Book Club; True Story","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202470606-playing-ball"

Sportswriter Terry Pluto profiles the colorful players who made that season so memorable,Pluto takes us through the entire 1964 season from training camp at Hiram College to the championship game in Municipal Stadium. Along the way he recreates an era and a team for which pride was not just a slogan.They were a team of men in the truest sense of the words, men who didn’t expect to be coddled, men who didn’t believe the world should genuflect at the mere mention of their names. They had the greatest running back in the history of football, and a coach who wore a hearing aid. Their quarterback had a Ph.D. in math. They had a defensive end who was a preacher, and a halfback who became a millionaire. Together, they won it all.Back before free agency, before shoe contracts and end zone dances, football was a tough game played by men who loved it. They had real jobs in the off season, as insurance salesmen or manufacturers’ representatives, and they lived in the community where they played. They were grateful to the fans for their support and believed that nothing they accomplished was important unless the team won."Pluto movingly reveals the substance of a mythic bond between men and a game, a team and a city—and thus lays bare how present-day pro football has surrendered its soul." — Kirkus ReviewsShow more","322","August 1, 2003","Biography Memoir; Memoir; Biography; Nonfiction; True Story; Book Club; Drama","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1170636.Browns_Town_1964"

A standout at the University of Florida, he helped the Gators win the national title in 2008. Drafted by the New England Patriots, in his second full season with the team, he and fellow Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski set records for touchdowns and yardage, and, with Tom Brady, led New England to Super Bowl XLVI in 2012. But Aaron's NFL career ended as quickly as it began. On June 26, 2013, he was arrested at his North Attleboro home, charged with the murder of Odin Lloyd, and released by the Patriots. Convicted of first-degree murder, Aaron was sentenced to life in prison without parole. On May 15, 2014, while on trial for Lloyd's murder, Aaron was indicted for two more murders. Five days after being acquitted for those double murders, he committed suicide in his jail cell. Aaron Hernandez was twenty-seven years old.In this clear-eyed, emotionally devastating biography-a family memoir combining football and true crime-Jonathan (formerly known by his nickname DJ) Hernandez speaks out fully for the first time about the brother he knew.

"Montana: The Biography of Football's Joe Cool","None","Keith Dunnavant","4.06","694","27","As long as football is played, Joe Montana will be synonymous with the heart-pounding rally. Seemingly impervious to the pressure of a scoreboard deficit, the quarterback known as Joe Cool brought a steadying calm to every huddle, especially when the situation seemed especially dire. His reputation for miracles began to take root at the University of Notre Dame. In the 1979 Cotton Bowl, he overcame the flu, hypothermia and a 22-point deficit to lead the Fighting Irish to a stunning victory over Houston. This narrative continued in the NFL, as he engineered 31 fourth-quarter comebacks, including victories known in professional football lore as The Catch and The Drive, forever casting his career in a heroic glow.In MONTANA, acclaimed author Keith Dunnavant sketches the definitive portrait of a man who repeatedly defied the odds, on and off the field.While leading the San Francisco 49ers to four Super Bowl championships over a nine-year period, establishing a new standard for passing efficiency, and twice earning the league's Most Valuable Player award, Montana became the signature quarterback of the 1980s and one of the greatest ever to play the game. Overcoming his own limitations, which caused him to be underrated coming out of Notre Dame, he quickly mastered Bill Walsh's West Coast Offense, and thereby, helped reinvent offensive football.But it was rarely easy. Like the rallies he so often produced, his life was filled with the sort of tension that made his journey seem routinely dramatic: The father who pushed him. The high school coach who challenged his commitment. The college coach who very nearly squandered him. The back surgery that almost ended his career. The younger athlete who tried to take his job.Rich an anecdotal detail, insight and context, MONTANA is a powerful story about a man who was defined by his intense competitiveness, and how this intangible helped him become one of the ionic figures in football history.Show more","336","September 15, 2015","Biography; Sports; Nonfiction; Football; Inspirational; True Story; Memoir","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23847960-montana"

But his most impressive victories have been deeply personal ones that were won when no one was watching.

Then, after signing the largest contract in sports history, anxiety nearly drove him to walk away from football completely. In short, Young’s quest in life was always about grit.

Yet its current dominance has obscured how professional football got its start.InThe League, John Eisenberg reveals that Art Rooney, George Halas, Tim Mara, George Preston Marshall, and Bert Bell took an immense risk by investing in the professional game. At that time the sport barely registered on the national scene, where college football, baseball, boxing, and horseracing dominated. The five owners succeeded only because at critical junctures in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s each sacrificed the short-term success of his team for the longer-term good of the League.At once a history of a sport and a remarkable story of business ingenuity,The Leagueis an essential read for any fan of our true national pastime.Show more","416","October 9, 2018","Sports; Nonfiction; Football; Biography; History; Memoir; Biography Memoir","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38525405-the-league"

"The Last Folk Hero: The Life and Myth of Bo Jackson","None","Jeff Pearlman","4.19","3,686","368","By theNew York Timesbestselling author ofShowtime—the source for HBO’sWinning Time—the definitive biography of mythic multi-sport star Bo Jackson.From the mid-1980s into the early 1990s, the greatest athlete of all time streaked across American sports and popular culture. Stadiums struggled to contain him. Clocks failed to capture his speed. His strength was legendary. His power unmatched. Video game makers turned him into an invincible character—and they were dead-on. He climbed (and walked across) walls, splintered baseball bats over his knee, turned oncoming tacklers into ground meat. He became the first person to simultaneously star in two major professional sports, and overtook Michael Jordan as America’s most recognizable pitchman. He was on our televisions, in our magazines, plastered across billboards. He was half man, half myth.Then, almost overnight, he was gone.He was Bo Jackson.Drawing on an astonishing 720 original interviews,New York Timesbestselling sportswriter Jeff Pearlman captures as never before the elusive truth about Jackson, Auburn University’s transcendent Heisman Trophy winner, superstar of both the NFL and Major League Baseball and ubiquitous “Bo Knows” Nike pitchman. Did Bo really jump over a parked Volkswagen? (Yes.) Did he actually run a 4.13 40? (Yes.) During the 1991 flight that nearly killed every member of the Chicago White Sox, was he in the cockpit trying to help? (Oddly, yes. Or no. Or … maybe.)Bo Jackson isn’t Jim Thorpe.He’s not Deion Sanders, either.No, Bo Jackson is Paul Bunyan.The Last Folk Herois the true tale of Bo Jackson that only “master storyteller” (NPR) Jeff Pearlman could tell.Show more","496","October 25, 2022","Sports; Biography; Baseball; Nonfiction; Football; Biography Memoir; Memoir","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60012371-the-last-folk-hero"
"Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman","None","Jon Krakauer","4.09","43,326","3,760","The bestselling author ofInto the Wild,Into Thin Air, andUnder the Banner of Heavendelivers a stunning, eloquent account of a remarkable young man’s haunting journey.Like the men whose epic stories Jon Krakauer has told in his previous bestsellers, Pat Tillman was an irrepressible individualist and iconoclast. In May 2002, Tillman walked away from his $3.6 million NFL contract to enlist in the United States Army. He was deeply troubled by 9/11, and he felt a strong moral obligation to join the fight against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Two years later, he died on a desolate hillside in southeastern Afghanistan.Though obvious to most of the two dozen soldiers on the scene that a ranger in Tillman’s own platoon had fired the fatal shots, the Army aggressively maneuvered to keep this information from Tillman’s wife, other family members, and the American public for five weeks following his death. During this time, President Bush repeatedly invoked Tillman’s name to promote his administration’s foreign policy. Long after Tillman’s nationally televised memorial service, the Army grudgingly notified his closest relatives that he had “probably” been killed by friendly fire while it continued to dissemble about the details of his death and who was responsible.InWhere Men Win Glory, Jon Krakauer draws on Tillman’s journals and letters, interviews with his wife and friends, conversations with the soldiers who served alongside him, and extensive research on the ground in Afghanistan to render an intricate mosaic of this driven, complex, and uncommonly compelling figure as well as the definitive account of the events and actions that led to his death. Before he enlisted in the army, Tillman was familiar to sports aficionados as an undersized, overachieving Arizona Cardinals safety whose virtuosity in the defensive backfield was spellbinding. With his shoulder-length hair, outspoken views, and boundless intellectual curiosity, Tillman was considered a maverick. America was fascinated when he traded the bright lights and riches of the NFL for boot camp and a buzz cut. Sent first to Iraq—a war he would openly declare was “illegal as hell”—and eventually to Afghanistan, Tillman was driven by complicated, emotionally charged, sometimes contradictory notions of duty, honor, justice, patriotism, and masculine pride, and he was determined to serve his entire three-year commitment. But on April 22, 2004, his life would end in a barrage of bullets fired by his fellow soldiers.Krakauer chronicles Tillman’s riveting, tragic odyssey in engrossing detail highlighting his remarkable character and personality while closely examining the murky, heartbreaking circumstances of his death. Infused with the power and authenticity readers have come to expect from Krakauer’s storytelling,Where Men Win Gloryexposes shattering truths about men and war.From the inside cover of ISBN 0385522266 / 9780385522267Show more","323","September 15, 2009","Nonfiction; Biography; History; War; Military Fiction; Sports; Politics","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2936415-where-men-win-glory"

"Murder in Buckhead","Jack Ludefance","Behcet Kaya","4.38","1,328","33","Bechet Kaya’s book four in the Jack Ludefance series, Murder in Buckhead, follows PI Jack's all-action mysteries proceedings, resonates with the author's knotty narrative, sparkling characters, and the ever-still place of realism as to the basic human aspirations.Buckhead, a district within Atlanta that boasts many high-end residences and businesses, is the scene of the discovery of a body. As the meticulous detective Shamir Turner assesses the circumstances of the alleged suicide of Casey Ray Olmsted, the son of the influential US Senator Bartholomew Jeremie Olmsted, he is certain of foul play (all shreds of evidence are contrary to the suicide claim). In the wake of Senator Olmsted's request not to proceed with the investigation of his son's death (since it’s a suicide), Turner has no choice but to do nothing (well, just officially...). Meanwhile, in his mid-40s, private investigator Jack Ludefance from Florida receives a phone call from Scarlet Olmsted asking him to look into the ‘real’ deed behind his son Casey's death. Blaire Olmsted, Casey's widower, issues a second exhortation, pleading with Ludefance to probe the senator (her father-in-law) who is after her life.Amidst the seemingly well-heeled proceedings of the murder-mystery investigation, Ludefance makes some unexpected discoveries about the case that goes against his reasoning. Blaire puzzles him with her switch between slyly seductive innuendos and her innocent persona, genuinely concerned about the senator and the threats he makes (a devious diva or an innocent suspect?). Additionally, not only has Blaire become a thorn in the motive of concealing the true story behind Casey's death, but Jack has also become part of the follow-ups and death threats. In a bind, Ludefance must deal with two situations that both get in the way of the corrupt and wicked Senator, who believes in getting rid of any weeds that might stand in the way of his objectives. With Rudy, the young expert hacker, Turner, the ever-ardent detective, and many incidental characters on board, the plot follows Jack’s adventure to unravel the mysterious death of Casey – suicide or murder, or is there an entirely different angle to the case?Through the luxury settings of Atlanta, the criminal underworld, and (not to overlook) the various eateries and human basic appetites for delicacies and meals, the author weaves an interesting tale that goes beyond a mere murder mystery riddle. All of the characters reveal their true selves in their own sexuality, backgrounds, and social positions, whether expressing natural human passion, appetite, or wrestling with their inner conflicts. Despite being a minor force behind the propagation of the murder mystery, the plot's plethora of characters, including Rudy with his subtle fatherly relationship with Jack, Cindy, Jack's sexual interest, as well as Turner and County Sheriff Lawson (aka Hiker), the ideal professionals and boon companions, provide enrichment to the plot with their unique presence and personalities.Show more","276","July 23, 2022","Drama; Book Club; Novels; Contemporary","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61789688-murder-in-buckhead"

He is handsome, well-educated, heir to the Redstone title and family fortune, and a fellow traveler of Mikaela Forsythe. He is also a member of the royal inner circle, close friend of the Prince of Wales, and well known to Mikaela’s aunt, Lady Antonia Montgomery.

Redstone is everything Brodie is not as far as society is concerned, and it drives a wedge between the two when he becomes suspicious of the man’s activities—a series of telegrams covertly sent and received, meetings in the middle of the night in places that are dangerous and frequented only by foreigners.

At the same time, Mikaela has noticed undeniable changes in Sir James—a forgotten experience aboard a ship they were on, an encounter with Bedoins in the desert, and the death of a fellow traveler. Small things to other people, but it raises her own suspicions of the man who has the appearance and manners of Redstone, and yet...Is it simply the intervening years and other travels that have dimmed the memories, or is it something more? Lily, now Mikaela’s ward, who is young and far more worldly than she should be, makes a startling claim about Redstone, well-learned from her previous experiences at that brothel in Edinburgh. Then a member of the royal inner circle is found dead, last seen in the company of Redstone, and both Brodie and Mikaela are forced to look at their own suspicions of the man. Is he who he claims to be? Or is he an impostor? If so, how and what does that death mean? Who will be next?

Since Miss Mayton is involved, he can assure himself that they are ghastly.Feeling hunted from every side and suspecting everybody in London is in on the plot, Darden narrows his eyes at every lady he meets.Lady Marianna Tisdale, eldest daughter of the Duke of Kembleton, has never held the usual views of a first London season. She has heard the ladies of her neighborhood wax on about the glories of the season—the balls, dinners, card parties, routs, musical evenings, the theater, and masques. She is intelligent enough to perceive that those things are just the veneer that pretties up the real reason for a season.She has a job to do, she is to get herself married. As her father is determined she does not marry below her rank, her choice of gentlemen will be precisely two. The Marquess of Mayfield and the Marquess of Wellerston, both destined to become dukes in the fullness of time. The prospect is about as thrilling as deciding between marmalade or strawberry jam.When Darden and Lady Marianna meet, sparks fly. Unfortunately, Darden is determined to stay a bachelor and Lady Marianna hopes to honor her father’s wishes.This would be the sort of thing that might be forthrightly straightened out to everybody’s satisfaction. However, it has been a longstanding tradition of the Bennington family to take a thing needing straightening out and promptly tie it into Gordian knots.And then, it seems a certain Miss Eloise Mayton has a long-time-coming Gordian knot of her own to straighten out.A Very Fine MuddleRomance Me, ViscountBe Daring, DukeStand With Me, EarlSweep Me Up, BaronWrite for Me, MarquessConvince Me, ViscountShow more","261","April 9, 2024","Historical Romance; Romance; Regency","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206840160-convince-me-viscount"

Obra aparentemente sencilla resulta, sin embargo, profundamente desconcertante. En su unidad formal descansa una gran diversidad de lenguajes, registros y tonos con los que Rulfo aborda la problemática de una violencia multiforme —desembozada unas veces, insidiosa otras—, hasta tal punto naturalizada que ha dejado de reconocerse como tal. Sin embargo, el autor no la "refleja" ni la "denuncia", ni tampoco la pone en escena: la persigue hasta sus repliegues más recónditos, compenetrándose con el sentir de quienes la ejercen o la padecen, sin alcanzar a reconocerla las más de las veces. O más precisamente: antes que la violencia misma, lo que los cuentos de "El Llano en llamas" ponen en escena suele ser ese oscuro y confuso bregar con su impronta en el sentir de quienes se vieron alguna vez envueltos en ella, sin advertir entonces su verdadero rostroShow more","210","September 18, 1953","Short Stories; Fiction; Spanish Literature; Classics; Latin American; Literature; Latin American Literature","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2075382.El_llano_en_llamas"

Como señala Jorge Aguilar Mora en su prólogo a este libro,Cartuchoesta en todos los vértices críticos de nuestro discurso histórico-literario: es quizás el libro más extraordinario, donde se funden la singularidad autobiográfica, el anonimato popular, la relación histórica, la transparencia literaria, la crónica familiar. Como ningún otro escritor de la revolución, Campobello se aproximó al acontecimiento pasajero, instantáneo, aparentemente insignificante, pero profundamente revelador. Ella no describió las batallas, ni las posiciones políticas; no rescató los testimonios extensos de los guerreros. Ella fue a su memoria para perpetuar los instantes más olvidables para otros y más intensos para quienes los vivieron. Ella escribió de lo sucedido en una tarde tranquila, borrada en la historia de la Revolución ; escribió de los momentos literalmente originales de la historia y de personajes únicos como Pablo López, como Catarino Acosta, como José Díaz, como Pancho Villa, un hombre que nació en 1910 , ya que antes nunca existió. Nellie Campobello escribió la crónica de lo que casi nadie quería, ni ha querido escribir: del periodo entre 1916 y 1920 en el estado de Chihuahua, que los historiadores coinciden en llamar la etapa más cruel que vivió Chihuahua durante la revolución y uno de los periodos más oscuros de toda su historia. El hallazgo iluminador de Campobello fue hundir la historia -la macrohistoria- en las minucias, en los rincones, en la anonimia, en los sobreentendidos, en los recintos más diminutos de la voluntad de los hacedores de esa historia. No hay detalle aquí que no tenga un sentido totalizador, no hay instante que no sea la grieta finísima por donde entra la eternidad. Este volumen contiene tambien, una cronología de la vida de la autora, que recoge los últimos datos disponibles, y una bibliografía actualizada.Show more","174","January 1, 1931","Spanish Literature; Short Stories; Fiction; Historical Fiction; Historical; Womens; School","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1176395.Cartucho"

Enquanto Laura vai à escola, brinca com as amigas e pouco a pouco se despede da infância, Margarida lê mãos numa feira de antiguidades para prover o sustento da família. A avó se devota por completo ao cuidado da menina, elo mais forte com sua filha, com quem não tem contato. Da mesma forma, Laura entrega a Margarida o amor desmedido de uma criança.O universo particular das duas, porém, se quebra com a chegada de Filipa, bisavó de Laura e mãe de Margarida. A idosa, que perdera o lugar onde morava, logo se apodera dos pequenos cômodos com suas caixas e amarguras.A mudança na rotina provoca transformações imediatas. Laura se vê sozinha, sem a atenção de quem mais ama, além de ter que se habituar à estranha presença da bisavó. Margarida, por sua vez, passa a se dedicar integralmente aos cuidados da mãe.

Ao mesmo tempo, como não poderia deixar de ser, a autora investiga a determinação inabalável feminina, os afetos que salvam e a força para romper com sofrimentos que parecem não ter fim."Abrir estas páginas é deixar-se levar por muitos caminhos, das arquibancadas de um circo a quartos fechados cheios de segredos, e perceber, com os cinco sentidos, a vida que aí se desenrola, não só enquanto palavra escrita, mas com seus odores, sabores, texturas, sons de pranto ou de canto, luzes e sombras." — Maria Valéria Rezende"Aline Bei confirma o domínio da arte de contar uma história ao mesmo tempo que inventa uma linguagem poética que devolve à escrita o encanto das vozes que a todos nos pertencem." — Mia CoutoShow more","272","June 1, 2025","Fiction; Audiobook; Womens","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233545712-uma-delicada-cole-o-de-aus-ncias"

O olhar fresco e bem humorado de quem ainda vê a vida como mistério está aqui, mas vá por mim: não subestime a solidão de Maria Carmem. A aprendiz de escritora, enfrentando as angústias da “pior idade do universo”, irá te provar que é possível, sim, que uma menina seja mais solitária do que um velho. Ao menos uma menina que, como ela, cresce e cria suas perguntas entre os objetos de uma “loja de velhos”. Ali elas já nascem antigas, frescas e pesadas, doce feito da mais dura poesia. Maria Carmem nasceu no fim. Sendo assim, do que interessa a idade? Como ela mesma diz, “é possível que um lápis pareça estar novo, mas todo quebrado por dentro”. É assim, toda quebrada por dentro, que ela desconstrói o mundo diante de si, o mundo adulto que cria regras e não as obedece, o mundo escolar, tudo: “na aula de matemática o problema dizia que um menino e uma menina precisavam calcular quantas laranjas levar ao parque se os convidados meninos comiam tantas e as meninas só mais tantas cada uma. E eu escrevi que não era pra levar nenhuma, que tudo é mentira, ninguém vai junto a parque nenhum nessa vida”. É também assim que ela junta e faz pergunta e faz poesia com tudo o que se ergue e desmorona, os pais, deus, o amor, o corpo, a morte, o difícil que é entender o amor dos outros. Quando crescer, Maria Carmem vai ser escritora. Mas Maria Carmem já cresceu e já é. Esse livro é uma generosidade de sua poesia.

Mesmo contrariado, o rapaz cumpre a promessa e faz a pé o caminho de Juazeiro do Norte até a pequena cidade de Candeia, sofrendo todas as agruras do sol impiedoso do sertão do Ceará. Ao chegar àquela cidade quase fantasma, ele encontra abrigo num lugar curioso: a cabeça oca e gigantesca de uma estátua inacabada de santo Antônio, que jazia separada do resto do corpo. Mas as estranhezas não param aí: Samuel começa a escutar uma confusão de vozes femininas apenas quando está dentro da cabeça. Assustado, se dá conta de que aquilo são as preces que as mulheres fazem ao santo falando de amor. Seu primeiro contato na cidade será com Francisco, um rapaz de quem logo fica amigo e que resolve ajudá-lo a explorar comercialmente o seu dom da escuta, promovendo casamentos e outras artimanhas amorosas. Antes parada no tempo, a cidade aos poucos volta à vida, à medida que vai sendo tomada por fiéis de todos os cantos, atraídos pelo poder inaudito de Samuel.

Com uma narrativa sensível e por vezes brutal, Jeferson Tenório traz à superfície um país marcado pelo racismo e por um sistema educacional falido, e um denso relato sobre as relações entre pais e filhos.O que está em jogo é a vida de um homem abalado pelas inevitáveis fraturas existenciais da sua condição de negro em um país racista, um processo de dor, de acerto de contas, mas também de redenção, superação e liberdade. Com habilidade incomum para conceber e estruturar personagens e de lidar com as complexidades e pequenas tragédias das relações familiares, Jeferson Tenório se consolida como uma das vozes mais potentes e estilisticamente corajosas da literatura brasileira contemporânea."Não é de graça que Tenório, além de autor premiado, é tão bem acolhido pelo público e pela crítica. Ele não faz turismo, safári social, na desgraça geral do país, não faz da crítica à desigualdade um truque, um atalho apelativo e barato, panfletário, para ter mais aceitação, reconhecimento. Estamos diante de um escritor que, correndo todos os riscos, sabe arquitetar uma boa trama e encantar o leitor.

Eu agradeço, a literatura brasileira agradece."– Paulo Scott"Através de um profundo mergulho em seus personagens, O avesso da pele consegue abordar as questões centrais da sociedade brasileira.

Não existe um critério absoluto para a riqueza no Brasil. Sempre haverá alguém com mais dinheiro, mais pompa, mais patrimônio, mais próximo do topo da pirâmide.

Durante a pesquisa, ficou claro que, a partir de um certo patamar, aos ricos não interessa mais o tamanho da conta bancária, mas os códigos que precisam dominar para fazer parte das altas rodas.Exibir grifes espalhafatosas faz sentido para os emergentes empenhados em ostentar a nova posição, mas é sinal de arrivismo aos olhos de um rico tradicional, que tende a optar por roupas discretas e só reconhecíveis por quem domina o mesmo repertório. O jogo de distinção está em toda a na escolha dos bairros para morar, na arquitetura e na decoração das casas, nos destinos de viagem, nos estudos e na linguagem.

Durante a celebração, ela recebe uma mensagem preocupada de uma amiga contando que errou o endereço e foi parar em “um lugar medonho”: o Largo do Maranhão, no Tatuapé, bairro onde Tati cresceu. O pavor da amiga desencadeia em Tati uma crise de pânico, o que a obriga a deixar a sala, os convidados e a certeza momentânea de seu pertencimento de classe.Com o humor habitual já conhecido pelos leitores deDepois a louca sou eueVocê nunca mais vai ficar sozinha, a escritora, roteirista e podcaster Tati Bernardi entrelaça, neste novo romance, questões sociais, políticas, amorosas e familiares, expondo feridas comuns a todos aqueles que ascendem socialmente. Se o tema já foi amplamente abordado por Annie Ernaux, Didier Eribon, Édouard Louis e, aqui no Brasil, por José Bortoluci, entre outros, emA boba da corteBernardi dá um passo adiante na tradição da autossociobiografia, acrescentando camadas de ironia e humor às narrativas de mudança de classe. Além de um relato autoficcional, o livro é também um retrato ácido da elite progressista brasileira e suscita uma questão inadiável: o que os bem-nascidos e herdeiros deixam de legado para o país?Mordaz e irônica, a protagonista não perdoa a ninguém — nem a si mesma —, e cutuca a ferida, torce o dedo dentro dela e depois o lambe, rindo.

Dove non arrivano le giurie, arriva lui, rapendo, torturando ed eliminando i criminali che l'hanno fatta franca. Indossa una maschera dai tratti demoniaci, e si fa annunciare ogni volta da un video intitolato La Legge sei tu in cui chiede alla gente di pronunciarsi in giudizio tramite votazioni anonime e irrintracciabili. A colpi di clic il richiamo alla giustizia sommaria diventa virale. Vendicatore spietato come il conte di Montecristo, villain incendiario al pari del Joker che sollevò Gotham City, il Giustiziere gioca la sua partita mortale. L'indagine sul caso che sta scuotendo l'Ita- lia è affidata al vicequestore Vito Strega, esperto di psicologia e filosofia, tormentato criminologo dall'intuito infallibile, avvezzo alla seduzione del Male. Lo affiancano le ispettrici Mara Rais ed Eva Croce. Diverse come il giorno e la notte, le due formano una coppia d'eccezione: i modi bruschi e l'impulsività di Mara sono compensati dall'acutezza e dal riserbo sfuggente di Eva.

Un giorno di sedici anni prima è arrivata a Norolani insieme con Jubanne, cui è bastato un attimo per innamorarsi e che l’ha sposata per proteggerla da un destino che gravava su di lei come una condanna. Eppure, per gli abitanti di quel paese dove il maestrale porta il respiro del mare, ormai è diventata un punto di riferimento. Perché Mallena è una llevadora che, mettendo in pratica il sapere antico tramandatole dalla madre, assiste tutte le partorienti, anche quelle delle famiglie più umili, senza mai pretendere nulla in cambio. Ma tutto precipita nel settembre 1917, quando Jubanne torna dal fronte ferito nel corpo e nell’anima. Per pagargli le cure necessarie, Mallena chiede a gran voce al consiglio comunale di essere remunerata per il suo lavoro e, ancora una volta, quel sussidio le viene negato. Come se non bastasse, in conformità a un decreto regio, viene assunta un’ostetrica diplomata, destinata a sostituirla.Arriva dal continente, Angelica Ferrari: nonostante la giovane età, per essere lì ha combattuto a lungo, sfidando le convenzioni sociali e la disapprovazione del padre, che voleva relegarla tra le mura domestiche, sposata con un buon partito. E adesso deve lottare contro la diffidenza delle donne del paese, che la vedono come un’estranea e rifiutano le sue cure. Dovrebbero essere rivali, Mallena e Angelica, invece sono le due facce della stessa medaglia, entrambe spinte dal desiderio di libertà e indipendenza, entrambe tradite dalle persone che avrebbero dovuto proteggerle e vittime della quotidiana ingiustizia che il mondo sa riservare soprattutto alle donne. Tuttavia, quando la situazione si farà insostenibile e i fantasmi del passato torneranno a bussare alla porta di Mallena, sarà proprio l’intera comunità di Norolani a pretendere che, per una volta, si faccia davverogiustizia.Una grande storia al femminile che, attraverso la lingua, i profumi, la poesia e la ruvidezza della vita quotidiana nella Sardegna d’inizio Novecento, narra di gente umile e schiva, ma unita da un profondo senso di comunità. E di una protagonista che, grazie a una saggezza ancestrale e alla solidarietà delle altre donne, matura in sé una nuova e luminosa consapevolezza.Show more","Unknown","May 27, 2025","Fiction; Feminism","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/232435829-la-levatrice"

Tutta la città ha sete, da settimane. C’è chi li chiamerà i giorni della Grande Sete, e chi le ricorderà come le Quattro Giornate di Napoli. È il 1943 e l’acqua manca ovunque, tranne che nella casa in cui Anna vive con la sua famiglia. Mentre davanti alla Casa del Miracolo si snoda una fila di donne che chiede quanto basta per dissetarsi, lei si domanda come mai la sua sete le paia così insaziabile. Perché quella che Anna sente è è una sete di vita e di un futuro di riscatto. A vent’anni vorrebbe seguire le lezioni alla facoltà di Lettere, leggere, vivere in un mondo senza macerie, senza l’agguato continuo delle sirene antiaeree. Ma non c’è tempo per i sogni. Il padre è scomparso, la madre si è chiusa in sé stessa, la sorella e il nipote si sono ammalati. Il loro futuro dipende da lei. Così, quando ne ha l’opportunità, Anna accetta un impiego come segretaria presso la base americana di Bagnoli. Entra in un mondo che non conosce, incontra persone che provengono da una terra lontana, piena di promesse, che incanta e atterrisce allo stesso tempo, come tutte le promesse. La cosa più semplice sarebbe scappare, lasciarsi alle spalle gli anni dolorosi della guerra. Ma Anna non vuole che qualcun altro la salvi. Come Napoli si è liberata da sola, anche Anna deve trovare da sola la sua via di salvezza. La grande sete non è facile da soddisfare. Viene da dentro e parla di indipendenza e di amore per il sapere e, soprattutto, parla del coraggio necessario per farsi sentire in un mondo che non sa ascoltare. Erica Cassano esordisce con una voce potente e profonda, capace di stupire e commuovere, rincuorare e ispirare.

Anne Serre poignantly depicts the bewildering back and forth between hope and despair involved in such a relationship, while playfully calling into question the very form of the novel.

They worked them hard at the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s office.We were at Denny’s, and I waited to drop the bomb until after we’d ordered breakfast but before it was delivered.Barnard’s hand trembled as he read the affidavit I’d just given him. I followed his eyes and saw he was halfway through the first page.“Tell Cal Dobson he has twenty-four hours to drop all charges against my client,” I said.I felt bad for the kid and hated that he had to bear the brunt of this. That’s why I was addressing him as if he were the messenger.“And then I’ll take this matter out of his hands, and it will get ugly,” I added as the waiter delivered our food. I took a sip of my orange juice but didn’t reach for a fork, not yet. I didn’t want to distract him from his reading.Barnard had been cocky before he’d seen the affidavit. He now bit his lip, turning whiter the further he got. I’d gotten the feeling when we’d first met up that he was proud to be doing this on his own, but he probably now wished he had the more senior Deputy District Attorney Cal Dobson with him.Show more","488","December 10, 2024","Unknown","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222482175-the-fixer"
